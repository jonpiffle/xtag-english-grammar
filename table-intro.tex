\chapter{Where to Find What}
\label{table-intro}

The two page table that follows gives an overview of what types of
trees occur in various tree families with pointers to discussion in
this report.  An entry in a cell of the table indicates that the
tree(s) for the construction named in the row header are included in
the tree family named in the column header. Entries are of two types.
If the particular tree(s) are displayed and/or discussed in this
report the entry gives a page number reference to the relevant
discussion or figure.\footnote{Since Chapter~\ref{verb-classes} has a
  brief discussion and a declarative tree for every tree family, page
  references are given only for other sections in which discussion or
  tree diagrams appear.}  Otherwise, a \xtagcheck \space indicates
inclusion in the tree family but no figure or discussion related
specifically to that tree in this report.  Blank cells indicate that
there are no trees for the construction named in the row header in the
tree family named in the column header.  Two tables are given below.
The first one gives the expansion of abbreviations in the table
headers. The second table gives the name given to each tree family in
the actual XTAG grammar. This makes it easier to find the description
of each tree family in Chapter~\ref{verb-classes} and to compare the
description with the online XTAG grammar.
