I used wordnet tempered by and in addition to my own intuitions.

tonia

---------------------------------
Presently anchoring Tnx0Vpnx1:


abound			with
V: be abundant or plentiful; exist in large quantities
		Something abounds -- "good food abounds (in this house)"
V with-PP: be in a state of movement or action. "The room **abounded with**
screaming children."

wordnet also has: **abound in** meaning "exist in large quantity"

account			for	(nothing to add)

add			to	
V NP (to-PP) "She added a personal note to the letter"; "add insult to injury"
also can elide PP "she added a personal note"

V NP add numbers -- can have plural object: she added 3 and 5. she added them
together. in addition to the "add NP to-PP" frame with this meaning.

V S add (say) "...," she added. (no PP)

V PP non-agentive "add" = add + to-PP (no NP complement) "this paper will add
to her reputation"

admit			to 
V NP "he admitted his errors" (acknowledge)
V PP "he admitted to his errors"
V NP PP "he admitted his errors to Mary" 

V NP (PP) "the club doesn't admit non-members" "we don't admit non-members into
our club" (let in) admit to/into
 
admit of: meaning afford possibility "admit of no possibility" -- don't know
how common this is??

admit onto: allow access "the french doors admit onto the yard" ??


advert			to		??

advise			against
V NP inf-S
V NP (about-PP)		i advised john about his finances
V NP of-PP		I advised him of his rights ***

agitate			with??? example?
V NP	the speaker agitated the crowd/ agitated them into action??

allude			to

amount			to

animadvert		on
?????

apply			to, for
PP is optional (elided?)
NP V the rule applies (to this case)  -- inchoative (be relevant)
V NP (to-PP) John applied the paint (to the house) (physical)
	but *the paint applied
V for-PP apply for a job

approve			of
also get elided "john didn't approve"

approximate		to
V PP I approximated to the nearest hundred.  (is this an arg?)
V NP PP I approximated the result to the nearest hundred.
V NP "her results approximate my own"
	"i approximated the result"
V	"i approximated"
V S "I approximated that John would leave at 5"


aspire			to
aspire to greatness
also S complement: i aspired to be an actress.

associate		with
V NP(plural)	"associate the two ideas (together)"
V NP with-PP	"associate one thing with the other"
V with-PP	"he associates with strange people"

attach			to, at?	   {under, on, ...???}--just give location
V NP(plural)	"i attached the two pieces (together)"
V NP to-PP	"i attached the hose to the valve"
NP-plural V (at-PP) 	"the two hoses were attached (at the ends)"
NP V to-PP	"

these??


attain			to??
NP		"she attained her goal"


audition		for
V for-PP
V NP?		"she auditioned on Broadway" "i auditioned 5 times last week"

avouch			for
??? i have no idea

barge			through (??), in-on (yes)
V into-PP	"she barged into the meeting room"
V through?	"she barged through the hall?"
V in-on

does it just take any path-phrase? she barged around the lake?? no.

batten			down
but is this a verb-particle? I battened them down. 

bawl			out(pl) <-agree. also intransitive: she bawled.


become			of  (in sense of "happen to")
also V NP

believe			in
Some of these are much more idiomatic and less compositional. do we have a way
to distinguish? should all of these be multi-anchors? this one definitely
should. 
believe S
believe NP
believe in-PP

belt			out (particle) "he belted it out"

border			on  (meaning "approach, come close")
also V NP

build			up
inchoative: resistence built up quickly   NP V PL
V NP	"the little pig built his house (out of straw)"

V up = particle? He built his courage up = He built up his courage.
*He built slowly up his courage.

bump			against, into, up, out
idiomatic use of "bump into somebody" meaning "saw" (also "ran into")
but other ones seem more compositional. are these other ones arguments?

bump out?? like "She bumped Mary out of line."? ??
bump up??

butt			against, into
V NP	"Canada butts the US"?? or do you have to say "abutts" or "butts
against?"
"the frames must be butted at the joints." "He butted the frames at the joints"

butt on (is also in wordnet)

capitalize		on

certify			?
V S
???

chase			down
particle: "i chased him down"
chase after "he chased after her for years" "the dog chased after the rabbit"

claw			into??
claw at


cleave			? 
cleave to	His tongue cleaved to the roof of his mouth
although wordnet has it only meaning "separate" (i thought it meant "attach")

cling			to

comb			through
also V PL NP -- she combed out her hair. combed her hair out.

combat			?

commiserate		-over ???

commune			-with

comport			with ????

condole			? (no idea)

conduce			? 

confide			in (yes)

connive			to??? 

consist			of (yes, some people say "consist in" also)

consort			with

consult			-with
I consulted John, I consulted with John. 
also allows plural subject and no object "they had to consult before making a
decision" (i.e., with each other).
if "with"PP is not argument, then need intransitive "consult"? only use is
"john consults for that company" (i.e., is a consultant) but i think this is a
different sense from "I consulted with John".

contend			-for (don't think "for" is argument)
V S	"I contended that..."
V NP	"they contended the result of the race"
V with-PP "they contended with great difficulties on their trip"

contest			-with???
V NP	"they contested the outcome of the race"

contrast		-with
V NP with-NP	"I contrasted Mary's report with Bob's"
V pluralNP	"I contrasted the two reports"
against?	"I contrasted the copy against the original"??

culminate		in
intrans:	"the meeting culminated"
V inPP		"the helmet culminated in a crest"  (form a summit)
		"the meeting culminated in a tearful embrace"
what about "end in"?

dab			-
dab on -- particle	she dabbed on the makeup, she dabbed the makeup on
also PP: "she dabbed the makeup on her face" -- but not argument

dabble			in
also dabble at	"she dabbles at painting"

deal			in, with ("with" more than "in")

deal out -- particle 
deal NP to-PP	"deal a blow to someone" -- normal ditransitive ("deal someone
a blow") 
or "deal a card to someone"


defer			to
V to-PP	"The government deferred to the expertise of the military"
V NP (to-PP/until-PP)	"defer the exam to a later date/until next week"

delight			in
V NP	"the gift delighted Mary"
V in-PP	"he delights in his granddaughter"

derive			from
V NP	"she derived the answer"
V from-PP	"the name derives from an older form" (inchoative?)
V NP from-PP	"derive pleasure from one's garden"

derogate		from ??? (no idea) 
none of the synonyms have a PP (for what that's worth) -- minimize, belittle,
denigrate 

determine		- (agree)

detract			from
V from-PP	"His bad manners detract from his good character"

deviate			from
V from-PP	"she deviated from the path" "deviate from the norm"
V NP??		"they deviated the river to prevent flooding" (example from
wordnet, but not a sentence i would use)

differentiate		---
V NP from-NP	"we differentiate this type from the other.."
V NP-plural	"we differentiate several types of sentences"
V NP		"this feature differentiates this type (from the others)"
		"how do they differentiate themselves"

i agree that this is less idiomatic, but i don't have as strong an
intuition as you do about it's non-argument status. again, definitely
semantically present.
seems obligatory to have two arguments -- either NP from-PP or have plural
object. like "disconnect from"

dispense		with
V NP	(different sense-- "distribute") "dispense medicine"
V NP from-PP	"I was dispensed from this terrible task" (granted an
exemption). "my boss dispensed me from this task"??????

V with-NP	"forgo, give up" -- "dispense with formalities"

distinguish		-between?
V NP from-NP	just like differentiate
V NP-plural

dote			on (yes), upon??

dwell			{on, upon} {on, in, under, over, ...}
dwell on -- seems to be idiomatic. ("upon" secondarily, but fine) -- this case
should be argument

not so sure about the "live" sense of dwell. wider range of PPs -- basically
anything locative. but this doesn't mean that the PP isn't an argument.
does the fact that you can compound tell us anything? "cave-dweller" means
dwells in a cave. but "bridge-dweller" only means lives on a bridge but not
under a bridge. (is that true?)

notice (tangentially) that "there" can substitute for locative PPs. can we
handle this now?

emanate			from
John emanated warmth.
Warmth emanated from John.
NP1 V NP2
NP2 V from-NP1			alternation

encroach		on
also "upon" ?  does every verb which takes "on" also allow "upon"?

estimate		---
V NP	He estimated the answer.
V S	He estimated that he would have to leave at 5.
V NP S-inf I estimate this chicken to weigh 5 pounds.
	He estimated the number to the nearest 100.
but i don't think the to-PP is an argument. (same with "approximate"??)

exceed			-
V NP
Wordnet has: "she exceeded out expectations"???? i can't get this use.

exult			in?
 I don't think I used this word. so i don't know. the meanings and synonyms
make it look like it should just be intransitive. but the sentence with "in"
sounds better than the one without.
She exulted in her good fortune. ??
She exulted.??

figure			in
V S	I figured that John would leave early.
V in-PP Elections figure prominently in every government program.
V out NP (particle)	He figured out the answer. He figured it out.

fix			-
V NP
V NP PP	She fixed her gaze on the man. fix the picture to the frame.
	decide upon??	She fixed on the boat. ??
V NP NP/ V NP for-NP fix mary an omelette/fix an omelette for Mary

get			{on} {on, under, around, ...}
got on a bus?? is it an arg in this case? otherwise, i don't think these
general locatives are arguments.
get it on?? idiomatic

V NP		("obtain")
V NP Pred	He got John into trouble. He got his squad ready.
V PP(goal)	She got home at 7./ He got into college.
		He got to Chicago after midnight.	
	arrive somewhere-- PP is goal	("home" can take place of PP in some
	cases: john ran home/ to his house) 
V NP for-PP/V NP NP	get me those books	(meaning fetch)
V at-PP		what are you getting at?
get out?
V to-PP		that really gets to me (meaning "bother" or "upset")

glance			at, over? 
(can this be any location/direction? he glanced over the hill. he glanced under
the table. he glanced towards mary???? i guess location -- not direction.

glory			in
i can't use this as a verb. but wordnet gives an intranstive frame.
Somebody glories. 
oh -- glory in god. ??? i don't know, since it's such a specific usage and i
can't think of any other examples, it's hard to tell if it's an arg or what.

gnaw			-at, into, on
i don't think "into" is an argument. "on" may be.
what about "gnaw at" in a figurative sense? the idea gnawed at me??

grab			-at, onto
I think the basic frame for grab is V NP
but then there are all kinds of PPs that can appear instead of the NP
The passenger grabbed for the oxygen mask. 


grasp			-onto, at
i think here even more than with grab that the frame is V NP
grasp onto doesn't sound as natural as grab onto

all 3 of these may involve conative alternations -- 
	ie. hit the ball/ hit at the ball
	gnaw the bone/gnaw at the bone
	grasp the cup/ grasp at the cup

	where intended result is not obtained.
we maybe should think about how to handle conative in the grammar as a separate
(but very related to all the issues you've been dealing with) question


gravitate		towards
V towards-PP

guard			against
V NP		guard the house
V NP against-PP guard the bridge against enemy attacks
V against-PP	guard against becoming too friendly with the staff

hail			from
(be a native of)	She hails from Kalamazoo.

hanker			for
(also V S-inf)

haul			--- (should be v-pl) (?? what should be a v-pl?)

hinge			on
V on-PP (obligatory)	(upon?)

hunger			-for
but possible without the "for"?

identify		with
yes -- i think "identify with" is a different sense from "identify"

impinge			on
V on-PP, upon-PP
is it the case that everywhere you can use "on" you can also use "upon"?

incline			---
raising verb? She's inclined to lie about the results. (only in passive?)
incline towards? She inclines towards lying.???

indent			?


inform			?
V NP of-PP	I informed him of his rights.
V on-PP		She informed on her own parents.

means "complain bitterly" synonym is "rail" rail against, inveigh against?? i
have no idea.

levy			-

possible to use intransitively? John luxuriated. ???
John luxuriated in the rich feel of the the silk suit.


major			in
yes

mention			---
V (to-PP) S	She mentioned to John that she was leaving.
optional to-PP -- should have same status as "say" (except that it's not a
bridge verb -- so should not get auxiliary tree that allows wh-extraction from
embedded S).

militate		against
Wordnet give frame as NP V NP -- but only example is: politeness militates
against this opinion being expressed. ???

misconceive		-
ok

mock			-at
??
V NP is only frame I can imagine for this.

opt			for, out, against
V out of-PP (not just opt out -- unless no PP "she opted out")
opt for-PP and opt out (of-PP) -- i think are complements
opt against -- maybe. less strong of a connection, but i don't know what this
means. "opt for" and "opt out" are listed as lexical items in word net, but
"opt" or "opt against" are not. again, i don't know what this means. it's a bit
strange that they don't have "opt" since you can say "i opted to go to the
movies". 
V S-inf

originate		---
it's funny, i think "originate" is weird if just intransitive.
?/* A new religious movement originated.
it wants some kind of PP, but really doesn't care what. could be locative (or
temporal?)/ source.  or other predicate?? 
A new religious movement originated in that country./ in the third century.
The flight originated outside of Dallas/ nearby/ at 5:00?/ from Boston?
The huge corporation originated from a few guys in a garage.

pan			out, over, up, ...

for me, only use is with "to"
ie, "to" is obligatory

pine			---
V for-PP	to pine for somebody/something
also possible: pining away -- V PL? 
John is pining away for Mary. John is pining away. John is pining away the
hours. John is pining the hours away.

pluck			-
entails a source when it means "pull off" -- pluck the feathers from the
chicken/off the chicken (don't know how to represent this or constrain the PP
in our current system, other than listing them. it's like the constraint that
"put" take a locative PP.)

also undergoes spray/load type alternation: I plucked the chicken (of its
feathers). (i loaded the cart (with hay)/ I loaded hay onto the cart)
how are these alternations handled currently?

pore			over
ok

post			?
affix a public notice: takes optional locative: I'll post a warning. I'll post
the news on the bulletin board.

parcel to their parents. V NP to-PP/ V NP NP

	      resultative?

provide			---
spray/load type alternation: the hostess provided lunch for all the guests.
The hostess provided all the guests with lunch. We provided the room with an
electrical heater.

what about "to provide for your children" "this provides for eventual
improvement of the system" meaning "make a possibility for"? (allow for)

purvey			?
"supply with provisions" wordnet gives NP V NP frame.

puzzle			over, at?
NP V/ V NP psych verb. I'm puzzled (about this?)/ This puzzles me.
puzzle over = try to solve. Somebody puzzles over something. (different sense
from "puzzle" in wordnet)
i don't think "at" really goes with puzzle.

quest			-for
like look for, search for, She quested for glory. easier as a noun "the quest
for glory"
V NP	wordnet: The animal came questing through the forest. ???
i have no idea.

range			-over
V from-to-PP	My students range from bright to dull. 
"Estimates for the losses in the earthquake range as high as $2 billion"
in a second sense, it's basically a "go" verb. so can take sources and goals
and paths. "wander"

be excessive in quantity	NP V
be deflected "his actions redound on his parents"	NP V PP
be added "everything he does redounds to himself"	NP V

relate			to
V NP-plural	relate the two ideas
V NP to-PP	relate this idea to the other

	(sort of a pseudo-passive -- has passive morphology, but isn't directly
derived from an agentive meaning.)

renege			on

It would be good if you could add comments to these lexical items if they dont'
already exist, giving a sentence so that later people looking at the grammar
can tell what use we had in mind.

other suggestions:

connect NP to		also connect + plural NP and connect pl-NP together
revert to
fall to	: V to-PP S-inf		It fell to me to take care of the children.

do "allot" and "assign" take the dative and double object trees?

note: it might help to do corpus searches on some of the ones we are not sure
of (in terms of what prep goes with a verb).


What tests should we use to show that these things are arguments.

One test is passive -- but not all PP arguments will allow their NP to undergo
passive. (just the ones that allow reanalysis). However, if they DO allow
passive, then they are definitely arguments.

Extraction? However, there are many PPs that allow extraction that we are not
considering arguments. One solution is to call all of these arguments. ??

obligatory-ness

non-compositional meaning
