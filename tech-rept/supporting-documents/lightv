{\bf Light Verbs}

Light verbs are one example of a construction that requires a multi-component anchor analysis. 
Light verbs occur in complex predicates such as {\it take a walk} and {\it
give a nod} in which the interpretation is non-compositional and the noun contributes arguement structure to the predicate. The interpretation of "take a walk" is close to the interpretation of the verb "walk" rather than a compositional interpretation of "take a walk" with "take as the main predicate. Comparison of () and () below illustrates this difference.

	() The man took a walk.
	() The man took a radio.

Light verb constructions also differ syntactically from other constructions with the same verbs. In examples () and () from Cattell(1984),  For example, "make" is and allows dative shift as in () and ()

	() He gave a book to John.
	() He gave John a book.
	() He gave John a nod

(corresponding to the verbs {\it walk} and {\it nod},
respectively).  We recognize light verb constructions with {\it do}, {\it
give}, {\it have}, {\it make}, and {\it take}.  Marginal candidates such as
{\it get} (as in {\it get a hold of NP} or {\it get a view of NP}) and {\it
put} (as in {\it put NP in writing} or {\it put the blame on NP}) are
excluded.  We have a separate analysis for predicative {\it be}, which in
the literature is often classed along with the light verbs.

Footnote: The (putative) light verb construction with {\it put} requires
two objects and does not undergo dative shift.  This does not depart from
the normal behavior of {\it put}, and therefore we see no need to include
it in the TAG analysis as a light verb.

We recognize as light verb constructions only those constructions that fit
the simple transitive (V-NP) or double object (V-NP1-PNP2 or V-NP2-NP1)
patterns.  According to the literature, the ``noun'' following the light
verb is (usually) a bare infinitive form and (usually) occurs with {\it
a(n)}.  However, we include deverbal nominals ({\it take a bath}, {\it give
a demonstration}) as well as constructions with bare infinitives ({\it have
a good cry}).  Constructions with nouns that do not contribute an argument
structure ({\it have a cigarette}, {\it give NP a black eye}) inhabit the
 ``idiom'' list.

Footnote: We have tried to include in the database as many light verb
constructions as possible, even if they do not occur in AmEng (e.g., {\it
have a think}, {\it have a bathe}).

Verb-adjective constructions such as {\it make NP angry}, although they
alternate with expressions like {\it anger NP}, are not included in the
light verb analysis.  Also, it is not clear whether the first verb in
serial verb constructions (e.g., {\it go hiking}, {\it come running}, {\it
keep nodding}) is more like a light verb or an aspectual auxiliary.  At
present we don't have an analysis for serial verbs.

English light verbs have partially specified argument structures which
combine with the argument structure of the associated noun to form a
complex predicate.  For example, {\it take a walk} means essentially what
{\it walk} means, but {\it take} imposes additional restrictions on the
types of entities that may be in subject position (for example, the subject
must be [+human]).

There are also semantic restrictions on the type of noun that may appear in
the predicate, but these are not useful to us as they are distinctions that
are not coded for in our lexicon.  (These restrictions have to do with the
aspectual nature of the construction and include space vs. time, length of
activity, whether or not the action is goal-directed, repeatability, etc.)

Light verb trees differ from normal transitive trees in that both the verb
and the noun in direct object position are marked as anchors.

\lheader{Syntactic Phenomena}

\lpar
Extraction.

The noun associated with the light verb (nx1, marked as an anchor) does not
extract.  Extraction may take place from any other position, including
extraction from within nx1:
\begin{verse}
What did John take?  *A jog \\
Who did an analysis?  John \\
Who did John make a promise to?  His mother \\
What did John do an analysis of?
  (cf. *What did John challenge an analysis of?)
\end{verse}
It would be nice to limit extraction from the subject position to {\it who}
and {\it which NP} (as an approximation of the [+human] requirement on
subjects in light verb constructions), but we can't implement this.
Further, it would not get us a correct parse in cases where an animal or
thing is anthropomorphized.

Extraction from complex NPs is blocked, except when the NP in question is
the noun anchor of a light verb construction (nx1).
\begin{verse}
*Who did John dislike an imitation of? Bush \\
Who did John do an imitation of? Bush \\
*What did John reject an offer of?  Real estate.\\
What did John make an offer of?  Real estate.
\end{verse}
Noun complementation has been implemented only for sentential complements.
The {\it of}-phrase (Ex: ``payment of five dollars'', ``promise of
financial support'', ``offer of money'', ``analysis of NPs'', ``imitation
of Bush'') will adjoin to the NP anchor and extraction from within nx1 will
be done with the simulated multicomponent adjunction trick.  This has not
been implemented yet.

In addition to the generalization that anchors do not extract, it appears
that indirect objects may not extract from post-verbal position in the
dative-shifted form.
\begin{verse}
The man made a promise to his mother \\
Who did the man make a promise to t?  His mother. \\
The man made his mother a promise \\ 
??Who did the man make t a promise?  His mother
\end{verse}
However, judgements on this are not firm and vary from speaker to speaker
and so we allow for extraction from indirect object position in the
dative-shifted form.

\lpar
Relativization.

In the first set of examples the relativized noun and its relative clause
constitute a complex noun that is only part of a light verb construction.
In the second set the noun is relativized out of a light verb construction.
\begin{verse}
The horse that won the race gave his groom a kick. \\
I finally got to take the nap that I'd needed all morning\\
The horse gave the groom a kick he'd never forget.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
The nap that I took this afternoon was refreshing. \\
The kick that I gave him was stunning. \\
The promises he made were outlandish.
\end{verse}
In examples of the type in the first set, the relative clause adjoins onto
the NP anchor that appears in the initial tree.  So for example {\it I
finally got to take the nap that I'd needed all morning} would start out
as {\it I finally got to take the nap}.  Then {\it that I needed all
morning} should adjoin onto [np the nap np], resulting in [np [np the nap
np] [s that [I needed all morning ]] np]

However, relativization of nx1 poses a problem for the TAG implementation
in examples of the second type.  For example, to get a correct parse for
{\it the nap that I took this afternoon}, the noun {\it the nap} must
combine with the tree for {\it that I took} $\epsilon$ {\it this
afternoon}.  But there is the conflicting requirement that as an anchor it
must appear with the initial S tree for {\it take-nap}.  The solution is to
exclude constructions containing what look like relativized anchors from
the light verb analysis.  That is, examples of the second type will not
receive a light verb parse, while the first type will.

Whether there is independent evidence to suggest that such constructions
are in fact not light verb constructions is a difficult question.  Whatever
the facts, this approach is consistent with other observations about the
constraints on wh-extraction and passivization as far as the noun anchor is
concerned.

\lpar
Dative shift.

At first glance, it appears that ditransitives with {\it give} have only
the dative-shifted form: {\it give NP a kick} vs. *{\it give a kick to NP}.
However, this restriction appears also to interact with something like
Heavy NP Shift:
\begin{verse}
The horse would give a kick *(to) anyone who came too close to him and
didn't offer sugar cubes.
\end{verse}
where the heavy NP moves to the end and appears as the indirect (dative)
object.  Light verb constructions with ditransitive {\it give} behave like
non-light verb constructions with distransitive {\it give} in this respect.
There remains, however, the problem of the nonextractibility of the anchor:
\begin{verse}
I gave the horse a kick. \\
What did you give the horse?  *A kick.
\end{verse}

Footnote: Allowing extraction from within complex nx1 anchors is not a
problem with ditransitive {\it give}.  What was once the direct object in
constructions such as {\it pull NP}, {\it kiss NP} now shows up as nx2 in
lv constructions such as {\it give NP a pull} or {\it give NP a kiss}, and
not as a complement of the anchor, which is the case in a-b below.
\begin{verse}
	a. imitate Bush				V nx \\
	b. do an imitation of Bush		V Nx1 Pnx \\
	c. kick the horse			V nx \\
	d. give the horse a kick		V nx2 Nx1
\end{verse}
Ditransitives with {\it make} also allow dative shift:
\begin{verse}
Make an offer to the police. \\
Make the police an offer of money. \\
Make a promise to one's mother. \\
Make one's mother a promise. \\
Make a payment of \$500 to your agent. \\
Make your agent a payment of \$500.
\end{verse}

% At present we do not parse the following constructions as shifts: \\ I made
% Mary a cake (cf. I made a cake for Mary) \\ I baked Mary a cake (cf. I
% baked a cake for Mary).

\lpar
Possessives.

Light verbs often allow a possessive on the noun in the predicate.  The
person and number of this possessive must match features of the subject:
\begin{verse}
She gave him her usual look. \\
\bad She gave him his usual look. \\
I took my nap.  \\
\bad I took your nap.
\end{verse}
Unfortunately, in certain contexts you can get a possessive on the {\it
give} ones:
\\ {\it John had begged and begged Mary to wait and wave to him from the
ship as it pulled away, so when she finally felt the deck moving underneath
her she gave him his wave and then went below to take her nap. \\ Every
evening when John came home he would pat the dog on the head and then yell
at his wife to make dinner.  On Tuesday, he walked in the front door, gave
the dog his pat, yelled at his wife to make dinner, and laid down and
died.}

The subject-identity requirement on possessives is not being implemented
since there are too many exceptions.  For instance, in a case where there
is a limited amount of hot water and John was planning to take a shower but
Mary gets there first, you could say ``Mary took John's shower''.

%God but you could do an interesting psychological analysis of these stories.

\lpar
Passives.

As expected, the noun associated with the light verb construction (marked
as an anchor) does not passivize, except with ditransitive {\it make}
constructions.
\begin{verse}
\bad A laugh was given by John.
\\ The groom was given a kick by the horse
\\ \bad A kick was given to the groom by the horse \\
An offer was made to John by a large conglomerate
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
\bad A laugh was given.
\\ The groom was given a kick.
\\ \bad A kick was given to the groom.
\\ After months of interviewing, an offer was finally made to John, but
Bill still hasn't heard a word.
\end{verse}
We include trees for passivization (with and without {\it by}) of the
direct object when it is not the anchor noun, with the exception of
ditransitives with {\it make}.
