%\subsection{Sentential Complements}
%    When the
% type of clause allowed as a complement is restricted, the English
% LTAG grammar enforces that restriction through specifying the value
% of the <mode> feature in the syntactic database entry of the
% anchor. For example, in () the syntactic database entry for think
% specifies the value of <mode> = ind, while the entry for hope allows
% for both indicative and infinitive complements.  Some of the
% theoretical reasons are discussed below.  Although many earlier works
% have presented strong arguments for considering so-called
% VP-complements as S-complements, we will review here just a few types
% of examples.  A full discussion of the theoretical benefits of
% S-complements is outside the scope of this report.  It has been
% observed (eg., by Borsley (1984)) that infinitival complements are
% subcategorized for by the same verbs as sentential ones and can be
% coordinated with them:

%(1)	John expects that he will see Mary today.
%(2)	John expects to see Mary today.
%(3)	John expects to be hired and that Mary will be his boss.


%(4)	John wonders whether to go to Macy's (or not).
%(5)	John wonders whether he should go to Macy's (or not).
%(6)	John wonders whether to go to Macy's and whether Mary will notice him.

%Although an imperfect test, coordination is often an indication of
%similarity of syntactic categories.  Notice also that in the second
%example, Whether, which is considered to be either a complementizer
%(as in LTAG) or a Wh-term of some type, dominates both the tensed and
%the untensed clauses.


%A similar phenomenon can be seen to exist between infinitival clauses
%and `for' clauses, as shown below:

%(7)	John prefers to go.
%(8)	John prefers for Mary to go.
%(9)	John prefers that Mary leaves early.

%(10)	John condescends to come.
%(11)	John condescends for Mary to come.
%(12)	*John condescends that Mary leaves early.

%If we consider {\it for} a complementizer (which will account for its being
%in sentential subjects as well), then the NP following it is the
%subject of the infinitival.

%For gerunds, the same parallels with tensed S-complements hold. An
%additional significant parallel holds between prepositional gerunds
%and that-clauses.  This was first mentioned by Rosenbaum
%(1967)\nocite{ros67} and was more recently studied by Freckelton
%(1984)\nocite{freck84b}:

%\begin{itemize}
%\item {\it John insisted on going to the beach.}
%\item {\it John insisted that we go to the beach.}
%\item {\it Going to the beach was insisted on (by John).}
%\item {\it $\ast$ That we go to the beach was insisted (by John).}
%\item {\it That we go to the beach was insisted on (by John).}
%%\endsentences
%\end{itemize}

%Notice that, although two different subcategorization frames seem to
%be involved in the active sentences, passivization shows that the
%that-clause is in fact to be analysed as a prepositional clause with
%(Prep + that) being reduced to {\it that}.  The tensed clause
%therefore does alternate with the gerund clause which is thus
%considered a sentential clause as well.

%Again, the few predicates that take only gerunds can be shown to have
%raising properties:

%\begin{itemize}
%%\beginsentences
%\item {\it John stopped/quit  lying to Mary.}
%\item {\it $\ast$ John stopped/quit that he lies to Mary / for Mary
%to be angry.} 
%\item {\it It stopped/quit  raining in BC.}
%\item {\it There stopped/quit being troubles around here.}
%%\endsentences
%\end{itemize}

%As mentioned above, there are also some practical benefits to adopting
% the S-complement approach for infinitivals and gerunds.  First, the
% same basic elementary trees used to represent tensed clauses can be
% used to represent infinitivals as well, making the grammar more
% efficient.  Second, this approach is the only one consistent with
% earlier work on English TAGs, if one wants to account for extraction
% out of infinitivals and gerunds (see next subsection).

\subsection{Extraction properties}

%Treating gerunds, infinitival complements and that-clauses as sentential
%trees allows us to define sentential auxiliary trees for the tree families
% of verbs that take these forms as complements.
%For example, the tree family for the verbs {\it think} and  {\it prefer}
% would include the following trees:

%\centerline{\psfig{figure=figures/prefer-kex.fig,height=5.5cm}
%\psfig{figure=figures/think-kex.fig,height=5.5cm}}
%\vspace{1.0cm}

%\noindent 
%Following Kroch and Joshi (1985), extraction out of sentential
%complements is accounted for in terms of elementary
%structures. Complement clauses are represented as initial sentential
%trees, and matrix clause auxiliary trees may adjoin to them. Since
%adjunction can happen at the internal S-node of a wh-tree, extraction
%is predicted with the matrix clause getting inserted between the
%wh-element and the rest of the complement clause. Adjunction allows
%this insertion of matrix clauses to be recursive.

%This analysis has numerous advantages. First, filler-gap relations are
%localized because the wh-element belongs to the same tree that its
%trace is an argument of. There is no need for ad hoc procedures to
%compute where a wh-element comes from or where it has to be passed to
%in the case of unbounded dependencies.  For example, devices such as
%functional uncertainty used in LFG become a mere corollary in a TAG
%(Joshi and Vijay Shanker, 1989)\nocite{jv89}.

%\noindent The derivation of the sentence, 
%``Who$_i$ do you think Mary loved $\epsilon_i$?''
%starts with structures shown below:
%%{\bf $\alphaW_1nx_0Vnx_1$}, and $\betanx_0Vs$.

%\vspace{0.5c
%centerline{\psfig{figure=figures/do-you-think.fig,height=8.5cm}\hspace*{1cm}
%\psfig{figure=figures/Who-Mary-loves.fig,height=9.0cm}}
%\vspace{1cm} 

%Note that the top and bottom values of the {\bf inv} feature
%on node S$_r$ in the second tree do not unify,
%forming an obligatory adjunction constraint.
%The resulting structure for that sentence is below:

%\centerline{\psfig{figure=figures/who-think-Mary-loves.fig,height=13cm}}
%\vspace{1.0cm}
%\centerline{{\bf Who do you think Mary loves?}}
%\vspace{1.0cm}


%Recursive adjunction provides derivations for the sentences ``Who do
%you think Bob said Mary loves?'', ``Who do you think Anne believes Bob
%said Mary loves'', and so on.

%ECP may be implemented either as a constraint on the form of initial
%trees, or as a feature constraint on the types of auxiliary trees that
%can adjoin to wh-trees. Our current approach is to specify
%$\langle$COMP$\rangle$= none (described further below) on the root
%node of tree-structures containing subject gaps (see below), so that a
%sentence such as {\it *Who$_{i}$ do you think that $\epsilon_{i}$
%loves Mary?}  can not be generated.

%\centerline{\psfig{figure=figures/Who-loves-Mary.fig,height=9.0cm}}
%\centerline{{\bf Who  loves Mary}?}
%\vspace{1cm}

%Extraction properties are also accounted for as constraints on the
%structure of the elementary trees, as was first shown by Kroch
%1987\nocite{k87}.  In the case of relative clauses, they follow
%directly from the structure of the elementary trees themselves:

%\vspace{0.5cm}
%\centerline{\psfig{figure=figures/the-man.fig,height=3.5cm}\hspace*{1cm}
%\psfig{figure=figures/who-saw.fig,height=5.5cm}}
%\vspace{1cm}

%Extraction out of relative clauses is thus ruled out because there is
%no way a sentence like: 

%%\beginsentences
%%\sitem 
%{\it $\ast$ Who$_{i}$ did you meet the man who loves e$_{i}$ ?}

%%\endsentences

%\noindent could  be derived, with such elementary trees, without
%either loosing the filler-gap relation or the desired word order.

%In the case of indirect questions, subjacency follows from the principle that 
%a given tree can not contain more than one wh-element:

%%\vspace{0.5cm}
%%\centerline{\psfig{figure=figures/do-wonder.fig,height=5.5cm}\hspace*{1cm}
%%\psfig{figure=figures/who-saw1.fig,height=5.5cm}}
%%\vspace{1cm}

%Extraction out of an indirect question is ruled out because a sentence like:

%\enumsentence{$\ast$ Who$_{i}$ do you wonder who loves e$_{i}$ ?}

%\noindent would have to be derived from the adjunction of `do you wonder' into
%`who$_{i}$ who loves e$_{i}$' that is an ill-formed elementary
%tree.\footnote{This does not mean that elementary trees with more than
%one gap should necessarily be ruled out. Such an option might actually
%be considered for dealing with parasitic gaps or gaps in coordinated
%structures.}

%Extraction can also be ruled out by using substitution, which is forced to
%happen at leaf nodes only, instead of adjunction for combining
%sentential structures (Abeille, 1988). Extraction out of adjunct clauses,
%for example, is thus ruled out :

%\vspace{0.5cm}
%\centerline{\psfig{figure=figures/since.fig,height=4cm}\hspace*{1cm}
%\psfig{figure=figures/John-left.fig,height=4cm}\hspace*{1cm}
%\psfig{figure=figures/who-left-1.fig,height=4cm}}
%\vspace{1cm}

%\noindent Thus the string `who$_{i}$ since e$_{i}$ left' cannot be generated,
%although the echo-question, `... since who$_{i}$ e$_{i}$ left?'
%would be fine. Notice that here using substitution instead of adjunction
%is  not an extra stipulation, it is imposed by the formalism, since
%otherwise the tree for `since' would have two footnodes and would be
%thus ill-formed.

%A similar device is also used for sentential subjects. It has long
%been observed that sentential subjects resist extraction (Ross,
%1967)\nocite{ross67}. But it has less often been noted that extraposed
%subjects may allow it :

%\enumsentence{Going to the beach pleases John.}
%\enumsentence{$\ast$  Where does going (to) please John ?}
%\enumsentence{It pleases John to go to the beach.}
%\enumsentence{? Where does it please John to go (to) ?}

%In the family of the verb {\it please} with a sentential subject, the
%tree for the non-extraposed case will be an initial tree (ruling out
%extraction) whereas the tree for extraposed subject will be an
%auxiliary one (allowing for it).

%A further distinction could be made between verbs that do allow
%extraction out of their sentential complements and those which don't:

%\enumsentence{John said that he hit Mary.}
%\enumsentence{Which woman did John say that he hit ?}
%\enumsentence{John stammered that he hit Mary.}
%\enumsentence{$\ast$  Which woman did John stammer that he hit ?} (Erteschik, 1973)\nocite{ert71}
%\enumsentence{John answered that he hit Mary.}
%\enumsentence{$\ast$  Which woman did John answer that he hit ?} (Culicover and Wilkins, 1984)\nocite{culicover-wilkins}

%Such phenomena require further study; but if the non-extractability is
%regular for all contexts of a given verb (and such seems to be the
%case for {\it stammer}), the corresponding tree family will probably
%be a different one with the complement clause being a substitution
%node rather than an adjunction node.


%As shown below, there are further variations, at least for verbs,
%depending on whether the context is interrogative, or negative, or
%neutral:

%%\beginsentences
%%\sitem 
%{\it John said that Mary was coming.}\\
%%\sitem 
%{\it ??John said whether Mary was coming.}\\
%%\sitem 
%{\it Did John say whether Mary was coming ?}\\
%%\sitem 
%{\it John did not say whether Mary was coming.}\\
%%\endsentences

%Other feature structures will be needed to capture these constraints
%on the tree for {\it say}.  But notice that the possibility of such
%variation is by itself lexically determined:

%%\beginsentences
%%\sitem 
%{\it John prefers that Mary leaves early.}\\
%%\sitem 
%{\it $\ast$ John prefers whether Mary leaves early.}\\
%%\sitem 
%{\it $\ast$ Who prefers whether Mary leaves early ?}\\
%%\sitem 
%{\it $\ast$ John did not prefer whether Mary leaves early.}\\
%%\endsentences
