The family Ts0N1 handles sentences such as "That you eat spam is the
problem", where the noun is considered the predicate (and is thus the
anchor).  However, it did not have any trees to handle sentences in
which the order is inverted, eg "The problem is that you eat spam."  I
saw no need to do anything elaborate and simply added the tree
alpha_N1s0 to the family, thus permitting these sentences.  I didn't
try to represent any movements, instead opting to just take the tree
alpha_s0N1 and swap the S substition site with the NP anchored by N.
