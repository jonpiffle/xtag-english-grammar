\chapter{Components of the XTAG System}
\label{overview}

This section focuses on the various components that comprise the
parser and English grammar in the XTAG system.  Persons interested
only in the linguistic analyses in the grammar may skip this section
without loss of continuity, although a quick glance at the tagset used
in XTAG and the set of non-terminal labels used will be useful. We may
occasionally refer back to the various components mentioned in this
section.

\section{System Description}

Figure~{\ref{flowchart}} shows the overall flow of the system when
parsing a sentence; a summary of each component is presented in
Table~\ref{sys-table}. At the heart of the system is a parser for
lexicalized TAGs (\cite{schabesjoshi88,schabes90}) which produces all
legitimate parses for the sentence. The parser has two phases: {\bf
Tree Selection} and {\bf Tree Grafting}.

\subsection{Tree Selection}

Since we are working with lexicalized TAGs, each word in the sentence
selects at least one tree. The advantage of a lexicalized formalism
like LTAGs is that rather than parsing with all the trees in the
grammar, we can parse with only the trees selected by the words in the
input sentence.

In the XTAG system, the selection of trees by the words is done in
several steps. Each step attempts to reduce ambiguity, i.e. reduce the
number of trees selected by the words in the sentence.

\begin{description}
\item[Morphological Analysis and POS Tagging] The input sentence is
  first submitted to the {\bf Morphological Analyzer} and the {\bf
    Tagger}. The morphological analyzer~(\cite{karp92}) consists of a
  disk-based database (a compiled version of the derivational rules)
  which is used to map an inflected word into its stem, part of speech
  and feature equations corresponding to inflectional information.
  These features are inserted at the anchor node of the tree
  eventually selected by the stem. The POS Tagger can be disabled in
  which case only information from the morphological analyzer is used.
  The morphology data was originally extracted from the Collins
  English Dictionary (\cite{ced79}) and Oxford Advanced Learner's
  Dictionary (\cite{oald74}) available through ACL-DCI
  (\cite{liberman89}), and then cleaned up and augmented by hand
  (\cite{karp92}).
    
\item[POS Blender] The output from the morphological analyzer and the
  POS tagger go into the {\bf POS Blender} which uses the output of
  the POS tagger as a filter on the output of the morphological
  analyzer. Any words that are not found in the morphological database
  are assigned the POS given by the tagger.
  
\item[Syntactic Database] The syntactic database contains the mapping
  between particular stem(s) and the tree templates or tree-families
  stored in the {\bf Tree Database} (see Table~\ref{sys-table}). The
  syntactic database also contains a list of feature equations that
  capture lexical idiosyncrasies. The output of the POS Blender is
  used to search the {\bf Syntactic Database} to produce a set of
  lexicalized trees with the feature equations associated with the
  word(s) in the syntactic database unified with the feature equations
  associated with the trees. Note that the features in the syntactic
  database can be assigned to any node in the tree and not just to the
  anchor node. The syntactic database entries were originally
  extracted from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary
  (\cite{oald74}) and Oxford Dictionary for Contemporary Idiomatic
  English (\cite{cie75}) available through ACL-DCI
  (\cite{liberman89}), and then modified and augmented by hand
  (\cite{EgediMartin94}).  There are more than 31,000 syntactic
  database entries.\footnote{This number does not include trees
    assigned by default based on the part-of-speech of the word.}
  Selected entries from this database are shown in
  Table~\ref{syn-entries}.
    
\item[Default Assignment] For words that are not found in the
  syntactic database, default trees and tree-families are assigned
  based on their POS tag.
  
\item[Filters] Some of the lexicalized trees chosen in previous stages
  can be eliminated in order to reduce ambiguity. Two methods are
  currently used: structural filters which eliminate trees which have
  impossible spans over the input sentence and a statistical filter
  based on unigram probabilities of non-lexicalized trees (from a hand
  corrected set of approximately 6000 parsed sentences). These methods
  speed the runtime by approximately 87\%.
  
\item[Supertagging] Before parsing, one can avail of an optional step
  of {\em supertagging} the sentence. This step uses statistical
  disambiguation to assign a unique elementary tree (or {\em
    supertag}) to each word in the sentence. These assignments can
  then be hand-corrected. These supertags are used as a filter on the
  tree assignments made so far. More information on supertagging can
  be found in (\cite{srini97diss,srini97iwpt}).

\subsection{Tree Database}
\label{tree-db}

The {\bf Tree Database} contains the tree templates that are
lexicalized by following the various steps given above. The lexical
items are inserted into distinguished nodes in the tree template
called the {\em anchor nodes}.  The part of speech of each word in the
sentence corresponds to the label of the anchor node of the trees.
Hence the tagset used by the POS Tagger corresponds exactly to the
labels of the anchor nodes in the trees.  The tagset used in the XTAG
system is given in Table~\ref{tagset}. The tree templates are
subdivided into tree families (for verbs and other predicates), and
tree files which are simply collections of trees for lexical items
like prepositions, determiners, etc%
\footnote{ The nonterminals in the tree database are {\tt A, AP, Ad,
    AdvP, Comp, Conj, D, N, NP, P, PP, Punct, S, V, VP}.}%
.

\subsection{Tree Grafting}

Once a particular set of lexicalized trees for the sentence have been
selected, XTAG a parsing algorithm for LTAGs
(\cite{schabesjoshi88,schabes90}) to find all derivations for the
sentence. The derivation trees and the associated derived trees can be
viewed using the X-interface (see Table~\ref{sys-table}). The
X-interface can also be used to save particular derivations to disk.

The output of the parser for the sentence {\it I had a map yesterday} is
illustrated in Figure~\ref{sentence}. The parse tree\footnote{The feature
structures associated with each note of the parse tree are not shown here.}
represents the surface constituent structure, while the derivation tree
represents the derivation history of the parse. The nodes of the derivation
tree are the tree names anchored by the lexical items\footnote{Appendix
\ref{tree-naming} explains the conventions used in naming the trees.}.  The
composition operation is indicated by the nature of the arcs: a dashed line is
used for substitution and a bold line for adjunction.  The number beside each
tree name is the address of the node at which the operation took place.  The
derivation tree can also be interpreted as a dependency graph with unlabeled
arcs between words of the sentence.

The morphological and syntactic databases are documented in
(\cite{karp92,EgediMartin94}). XTAG also has a parsing and grammar
development interface documented in (\cite{PSJ92}). This interface
includes a tree editor, the ability to vary parameters in the parser,
work with multiple grammars and/or parsers, and use metarules for more
efficient tree editing and construction (\cite{becker94}). These
papers refer to an earlier version of the grammar development
tools. They have been replaced by newer implementations which are
described on the XTAG web page. Also, more information and download
instructions about the XTAG grammar, the parser and the grammar
development interface can be obtained on the XTAG web page at \\ {\tt
