\chapter{Underview} 
\label{underview} 
 
The morphological, syntactic, and tree databases together comprise the 
English grammar\footnote{ See Chapter~\ref{overview} for details on these levels of representation. }.  A lexical item that is not in the 
databases receives a default tree selection and features for its part 
of speech and morphology.  
 
In designing the grammar, a decision was made early on to err on the 
side of acceptance whenever there are conflicting opinions as to 
whether or not a construction is grammatical.  In this sense, the XTAG 
English grammar is intended to function primarily as an acceptor 
rather than a generator of English sentences.  The range of syntactic 
phenomena that can be handled is large and includes auxiliaries 
(including inversion), copula, raising and small clause constructions, 
topicalization, relative clauses, infinitives, gerunds, passives, 
adjuncts, it-clefts, wh-clefts, PRO constructions, noun-noun 
modifications, determiner sequences, genitives, negation, noun-verb 
contractions, clausal adjuncts and imperatives. 
 
This chapter is meant to be an introductory look at grammar 
organization in XTAG. It serves as basic information the reader would 
need to read the more detailed information about the grammar in 
subsequent parts of the technical report. 
 
\section{Tree Families and Subcategorization Frames} 
\label{subcat-frames} 
 
Elementary trees for predicative words\footnote{ Such as non-auxiliary verbs or predicative nouns. } are used to represent the linguistic 
notion of subcategorization.  The anchor of the elementary tree 
subcategorizes for the other elements that appear in the tree, forming 
a clausal or sentential structure.  Tree families group together trees 
that belong to the same subcategorization frame. Consider the 
following uses of the verb {\it buy}: 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Srini bought a book.}\label{ex:110} 
\sitem{Srini bought Beth a book.}\label{ex:111} 
\endsentences

 
In sentence (\ref{ex:110}), the verb {\it buy} subcategorizes for a direct 
object NP.  The elementary tree anchored by {\it buy} is shown in 
Figure~\ref{subcat-trees}(a) and includes nodes for the NP complement 
of {\it buy} and for the NP subject.  In addition to this declarative 
tree structure, the tree family also contains the trees that would be 
related to each other transformationally in a movement based approach, 
i.e passivization, imperatives, wh-questions, relative clauses, and so 
forth.  Each tree family selected by its anchor represents all the 
various syntactic environments that it can appear in. 
 
Sentence (\ref{ex:111}) shows that {\it buy} also subcategorizes for 
a double NP object.  This means that {\it buy} also selects the double 
NP object subcategorization frame, or tree family, with its own set of 
transformationally related sentence structures. 
Figure~\ref{subcat-trees}(b) shows the declarative structure for this 
set of sentence structures.

Entire classes of anchors select a tree family. All the transitive 
verbs form a class which selects the transitive tree family. Recall 
that a tree family is a group of trees related by some syntactic 
transformations. Since an entire class of anchors are selecting this 
tree family, the assumption is that these syntactic transformations 
are valid for each member of this class. For instance, wh- extraction 
is a syntactic transformation that will apply regardless of any 
idiosyncratic properties of any particular anchor of the tree family. 
Chapter~\ref{verb-classes} contains more information about 
the different tree families in the grammar. 
 
There are some syntactic transformations, however, that are sensitive 
to the properties of a particular anchor within the same 
subcategorization frame. The ergative (or transitive-inchoative) 
alternation for transitive verbs is one such transformation. Only a 
subset of the transitive verbs can undergo this transformation. A more 
rigorous definition of tree family that accounts for such lexical 
idiosyncrasies within an otherwise homogeneous family is discussed in 
detail in Appendix~\ref{families}. 
 
\section{Complements and Adjuncts} 
\label{compl-adj} 
 
Complements and adjuncts have very different structures in the XTAG grammar. 
Complements are included in the elementary tree anchored by the verb that 
selects them, while adjuncts do not originate in the same elementary tree as 
the verb anchoring the sentence, but are instead added to a structure by 
adjunction.  The contrasts between complements and adjuncts have been 
extensively discussed in the linguistics literature and the classification of a 
given element as one or the other remains a matter of debate (see 
\cite{rizzi90}, 
\cite{larson88}, \cite{jackendoff90}, \cite{larson90}, \cite{cinque90}, 
\cite{obernauer84}, \cite{lasnik-saito84}, and \cite{chomsky86}).  The guiding 
rule used in developing the XTAG grammar is whether or not the sentence is 
ungrammatical without the questioned structure.\footnote{Iteration of a structure can also be used as a diagnostic: {\it Srini bought a book at the bookstore on Walnut Street for a friend}.} Consider the following 
sentences: 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Srini bought a book.}\label{ex:112} 
\sitem{Srini bought a book at the bookstore.}\label{ex:113} 
\sitem{Fei ventured into the cave.}\label{ex:114} 
\sitem{$\ast$Fei ventured.}\label{ex:115} 
\endsentences

 
Prepositional phrases are common adjuncts, and when they are used as 
adjuncts they have a tree structure such as that shown in 
Figure~\ref{compl-adjunct}(a).  This adjunction tree would adjoin into 
the tree shown in Figure~\ref{subcat-trees}(a) to generate sentence 
(\ref{ex:113}).  There are verbs, however, such as {\it venture}, {\it hunger} and {\it differentiate}, that take prepositional phrases as 
complements.  Sentences (\ref{ex:114}) and (\ref{ex:115}) clearly show that the 
prepositional phrase are not optional for {\it venture}. 
% For these 
%sentences, the prepositional phrase will be an initial tree (as shown 
%in Figure~\ref{compl-adjunct}(b)) that substitutes into an elementary 
%tree, such as the one anchored by the verb {\it arrange} in 
%Figure~\ref{compl-adjunct}(c). 
For verbs such as this, the prepositional phrase is articulated within the 
verb's elementary tree, as shown in Figure~\ref{compl-adjunct}(b). The 
preposition and its complement noun phrase are substituted into this elementary 
tree.

Virtually all parts of speech, except for main verbs, function as both 
complements and adjuncts in the grammar.  More information is available in this 
report on various parts of speech as complements: adjectives (e.g. section 
\ref{nx0Vax1-family}), nouns (e.g.  section~\ref{nx0Vnx1-family}), and 
prepositions (e.g. section~\ref{nx0Vpnx1-family}); and as adjuncts: adjectives 
(section~\ref{adj-modifier}), adverbs (section~\ref{adv-modifier}), nouns 
(section~\ref{noun-modifier}), and prepositions (section~\ref{prep-modifier}). 
 
\section{Non-S constituents} 
 
Although sentential trees are generally considered to be special cases 
in any grammar, insofar as they make up a `starting category', it is 
the case that any initial tree constitutes a phrasal constituent. 
These initial trees may have substitution nodes that need to be filled 
(by other initial trees), and may be modified by adjunct trees, 
exactly as the trees rooted in S.  Although grouping is possible 
according to the heads or anchors of these trees, we have not found 
any classification similar to the subcategorization frames for verbs 
that can be used by a lexical entry to create a tree family of the set 
of trees selected by such entries.  These trees are selected one by 
one by each lexical item, according to each lexical item's 
idiosyncrasies.  The grammar described by this technical report places 
them into several files for ease of use, but these files do not 
constitute tree families in the way that the subcategorization frames 
do.
