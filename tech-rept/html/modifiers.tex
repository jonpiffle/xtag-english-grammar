\chapter{Modifiers} 
\label{modifiers} 
 
This chapter covers various types of modifiers: adverbs, prepositions, 
adjectives, and noun modifiers in noun-noun compounds.\footnote{Relative clauses are discussed in Chapter~\ref{rel_clauses}.}  These categories 
optionally modify other lexical items and phrases by adjoining onto them.  In 
their modifier function these items are adjuncts; they are not part of the 
subcategorization frame of the items they modify.  Examples of some of these 
modifiers are shown in (\ref{ex:330})-(\ref{ex:332}). 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{[$_{ADV}$ certainly $_{ADV}$], the October 13 sell-off didn't settle any stomachs . (WSJ)}\label{ex:330} 
\endsentences

 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Mr. Bakes [$_{ADV}$ previously $_{ADV}$] had a turn at running Continental . (WSJ)}\label{ex:331} 
\endsentences

 
\beginsentences
\sitem{most [$_{ADJ}$ foreign $_{ADJ}$] [$_{N}$ government $_{N}$] [$_{N}$ bond $_{N}$] prices rose [$_{PP}$ during the week $_{PP}$]. }\label{ex:332} 
\endsentences

 
The trees used for the various modifiers are quite similar in form. 
The modifier anchors the tree and the root and foot nodes of the tree 
are of the category that the particular anchor modifies. Some 
modifiers, e.g. prepositions, select for their own arguments and those 
are also included in the tree.  The foot node may be to the right or 
the left of the anchoring modifier (and its arguments) depending on 
whether that modifier occurs before or after the category it 
modifies. For example, almost all adjectives appear to the left of the 
nouns they modify, while prepositions appear to the right when 
modifying nouns. 
 
 
\section{Adjectives} 
\label{adj-modifier} 
 
In addition to being modifiers, adjectives in the XTAG English grammar can be 
also anchor clauses (see Adjective Small Clauses in 
Chapter~\ref{small-clauses}).  There is also one tree family, Intransitive with 
Adjective (Tnx0Vax1), that has an adjective as an argument and is used for 
sentences such as {\it Seth felt happy}. In that tree family the adjective 
substitutes into the tree rather than adjoining as is the case for modifiers.

\begin{rawhtml} <dl> <dt>{Standard Tree for Adjective modifying a Noun: $\beta$An <p> </dl> \end{rawhtml}
\label {An-tree} 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
 
As modifiers, adjectives anchor the tree shown in 
Figure~\ref{An-tree}.  The features of the N node onto which the 
$\beta$An tree adjoins are passed through to the top node of the 
resulting N.  The null adjunction marker (NA) on the N foot node 
imposes right binary branching such that each subsequent adjective 
must adjoin on top of the leftmost adjective that has already 
adjoined.  Due to the NA constraint, a sequence of adjectives will 
have only one derivation in the XTAG grammar. The adjective's 
morphological features such as superlative or comparative are 
instantiated by the morphological analyzer. See 
Chapter~\ref{compars-chapter} for a description of how we handle 
comparatives.  At this point, the treatment of adjectives in the XTAG 
English grammar does not include selectional or ordering 
restrictions. Consequently, any adjective can adjoin onto any noun and 
on top of any other adjective already modifying a noun. All of the 
modified noun phrases shown in (\ref{ex:333})-(\ref{ex:336}) currently parse with 
the same structure shown for {\it colorless green ideas\/} in Figure 
\ref{colorless-green-adj}. 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{big green bugs}\label{ex:333} 
\sitem{big green ideas}\label{ex:334} 
\sitem{colorless green ideas}\label{ex:335} 
\sitem{?green big ideas}\label{ex:336} 
\endsentences

\begin{rawhtml} <dl> <dt>{Multiple adjectives modifying a noun <p> </dl> \end{rawhtml}
\label {colorless-green-adj} 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
 
 
While (\ref{ex:334})-(\ref{ex:336}) are all semantically anomalous, (\ref{ex:336}) also 
suffers from an ordering problem that makes it seem ungrammatical in 
the absence of any licensing context. One could argue that the grammar 
should accept (\ref{ex:333})-(\ref{ex:335}) but not (\ref{ex:336}).  One of the future 
goals for the grammar is to develop a treatment of adjective ordering 
similar to that developed by 
\cite{ircs:det98} for determiners\footnote{See Chapter~\ref{det-comparitives} or \cite{ircs:det98} for details of the determiner analysis.}. An adequate implementation of ordering 
restrictions for adjectives would rule out (\ref{ex:336}). 
 
\section{Noun-Noun Modifiers} 
\label{noun-modifier} 
 
Noun-noun compounding in the English XTAG grammar is very similar to 
adjective-noun modification.  The noun modifier tree, shown in 
Figure~\ref{noun-compound-tree}, has essentially the same structure as the 
adjective modifier tree in Figure~\ref{An-tree}, except for the syntactic 
category label of the anchor.  
 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}

\begin{tabular}{c} 
{\htmladdimg{ps/modifiers-files/betaNn.ps.gif}}

\label {noun-compound-tree} 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
 
 
Noun compounds have a variety of scope possibilities not available to 
adjectives, as illustrated by the single bracketing possibility in (\ref{ex:337}) and 
the two possibilities for (\ref{ex:338}).  This ambiguity is manifested in the XTAG 
grammar by the two possible adjunction sites in the noun-noun compound tree 
itself.  Subsequent modifying nouns can adjoin either onto the N$_r$ node or 
onto the N anchor node of that tree, which results in exactly the two 
bracketing possibilities shown in (\ref{ex:338}).  This inherent structural ambiguity 
results in noun-noun compounds regularly having multiple derivations. However, 
the multiple derivations are not a defect in the grammar because they are 
necessary to correctly represent the genuine ambiguity of these phrases. 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{[$_{N}$ big [$_{N}$ green design $_{N}$]$_{N}$]}\label{ex:337} 
\endsentences

 
\beginsentences
\sitem{[$_{N}$ computer [$_{N}$ furniture design $_{N}$]$_{N}$]\\ \/~~[$_{N}$ [$_{N}$ computer furniture $_{N}$] design $_{N}$]}\label{ex:338} 
\endsentences

 
Noun-noun compounds have no restriction on number.  XTAG allows nouns to be either singular or plural as in (\ref{ex:339})-(\ref{ex:341}). 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Hyun is taking an algorithms course .}\label{ex:339} 
\sitem{waffles are in the frozen foods section .}\label{ex:340} 
\sitem{I enjoy the dog shows .}\label{ex:341} 
\endsentences

 
\section{Time Noun Phrases} 
\label{timenps} 
 
%% \subsection{Introduction} 
 
 
Although in general NPs cannot modify clauses or other NPs, there is a 
class of NPs, with meanings that relate to time, that can do 
so.\footnote{ There may be other classes of NPs, such as directional phrases, such as {\em north, south} etc., which behave similarly. We have not yet analyzed these phrases.} We call this class of NPs 
``Time~NPs''.  Time~NPs behave essentially like PPs. Like PPs, 
time~NPs can adjoin at four places: to the right of an NP, to the 
right and left of a VP, and to the left of an~S. 
 
Time~NPs may include determiners, as in {\em this week} in example 
(\ref{ex:342}), or may be single lexical items as in {\em today} in example 
(\ref{ex:343}).  Like other NPs, time~NPs can also include adjectives, as in 
example (\ref{ex:347}). 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Elvis left the building \underline{this week}}\label{ex:342} 
\sitem{Elvis left the building \underline{today}}\label{ex:343} 
\sitem{It has no bearing on our work force \underline{today} (WSJ)}\label{ex:344} 
\sitem{The fire \underline{yesterday} claimed two lives}\label{ex:345} 
\endsentences

%% In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index rose 35.28 
%% points to 35452.72. 
%% \enumsentence{It has no bearing \underline{today} on our work force} 
\beginsentences
\sitem{\underline{Today} it has no bearing on our work force}\label{ex:346} 
\sitem{Michael \underline{late yesterday} announced a buy-back program}\label{ex:347} 
\endsentences

%% Michael late yesterday announced a $ 3.8 million stock buy-back program . 
 
The XTAG analysis for time~NPs is fairly simple, requiring only the 
creation of proper NP auxiliary trees.  Only nouns that can be part of 
time~NPs will select the relevant auxiliary trees, and so only these 
type of NPs will behave like PPs under the XTAG analysis. 
Currently, about 60 words select Time~NP trees, but since these 
words can form NPs that include determiners and adjectives, a large 
number of phrases are covered by this class of modifiers. 
 
Corresponding to the four positions listed above, time~NPs 
can select one of the four trees shown in Figure~\ref{timenp-trees}.

Determiners can be added to time~NPs by adjunction in 
the same way that they are added to NPs in other 
positions. The trees in Figure~\ref{everymonth} show that the 
structures of examples (\ref{ex:342}) and (\ref{ex:343}) differ only in the 
adjunction of  {\em this} to the time~NP in example (\ref{ex:342}).

The sentence 
\beginsentences

has (at least) two different interpretations, depending on whether 
{\em Tuesday} attaches to {\em said} or to {\em started}. 
Valid time~NP analyses are available for both these interpretations and 
are shown in Figure~\ref{esso}.

\section{Prepositions} 
\label{prep-modifier} 
 
There are three basic types of prepositional phrases, and three places 
at which they can adjoin.  The three types of prepositional phrases 
are: Preposition with NP Complement, Preposition with Sentential 
Complement, and Exhaustive Preposition.  The three places are to the 
right of an NP, to the right of a VP, and to the left of an S.  Each 
of the three types of PP can adjoin at each of these three places, for 
a total of nine PP modifier trees. Table \ref{prep-summary} gives the 
tree family names for the various combinations of type and 
location. (See Section \ref{post-PP} for discussion of the 
$\beta$spuPnx, which handles post-sentential comma-separated PPs.) 
 
\begin{table}[htb] 
\centering 
\begin{tabular}{|l||c|c|c|} 
\hline 
\multicolumn{1}{|c||}{}&\multicolumn{3}{c|}{position and category modified}\\

illustrates the locations and the four PP types.  Example sentences using the 
trees in Figure \ref{prep-trees} are shown in (\ref{ex:349})-(\ref{ex:352}). There are also 
more trees with multi-word prepositions as anchors. Examples of these are: 
{\it ahead of}, {\it contrary to}, {\it at variance with} and {\it as recently as}.

\sitem{Clove played frisbee [$_{PP}$ outside of the house $_{PP}$] . ($\beta$vxPPnx)}\label{ex:352} 
\endsentences

 
Prepositions that take NP complements assign accusative case to those 
complements (see section~\ref{prep-case} for details).  Most prepositions take 
NP complements.  Subordinating conjunctions are analyzed in XTAG as Preps 
(see Section~\ref{adjunct-cls} for details). Additionally, a few non-conjunction 
prepositions take S complements (see Section~\ref{NPA} for details). 
 
 
\section{Adverbs} 
\label{adv-modifier} 
 
In the English XTAG grammar, VP and S-modifying adverbs anchor the 
auxiliary trees $\beta$vxARB and $\beta$ARBvx, $\beta$ARBs, 
$\beta$sARB,\footnote{In the naming conventions for the XTAG trees, ARB is used for {\underline a}dve{\underline {rb}}s.  Because the letters in A, Ad, and Adv are all used for other parts of speech ({\underline a}djective, {\underline d}eterminer and {\underline v}erb), ARB was chosen to eliminate ambiguity. Appendix~\ref{tree-naming} contains a full explanation of naming conventions.}  allowing pre and post modification of S's and VP's. 
Besides the VP and S-modifying adverbs, the grammar includes adverbs 
that modify other categories. Examples of adverbs modifying an 
adjective, an adverb, a PP, an NP, and a determiner are shown in 
(\ref{ex:353})-(\ref{ex:360}). (See Sections \ref{par-adverb} and 
\ref{post-adverb} for discussion of the $\beta$puARBpuvx and 
$\beta$spuARB, which handle pre-verbal parenthetical adverbs and 
post-sentential comma-separated adverbs.) 
 
\begin{itemize} 
\item{Modifying an adjective} 
\beginsentences
\sitem{{\bf extremely} good}\label{ex:353} 
\sitem{{\bf rather} tall}\label{ex:354} 
\sitem{rich {\bf enough}}\label{ex:355} 
\endsentences

 
\item{Modifying an adverb} 
\beginsentences
\sitem{oddly {\bf enough}}\label{ex:356} 
\sitem{{\bf very} well}\label{ex:357} 
\endsentences

 
\item{Modifying a PP} 
\beginsentences
\sitem{{\bf right} through the wall}\label{ex:358} 
\endsentences

 
\item{Modifying a NP} 
\beginsentences
\sitem{{\bf quite} some time}\label{ex:359} 
\endsentences

 
\item{Modifying a determiner} 
\beginsentences
\sitem{{\bf exactly} five men}\label{ex:360} 
\endsentences

 
\end{itemize} 
 
XTAG has separate trees for each of the modified categories and for pre and 
post modification where needed.  The kind of treatment given to adverbs here is 
very much in line with the base-generation approach proposed by \cite{Ernst84}, 
which assumes all positions where an adverb can occur to be base-generated, and 
that the semantics of the adverb specifies a range of possible positions 
occupied by each adverb. While the relevant semantic features of the adverbs 
are not currently implemented, implementation of semantic features is scheduled 
for future work.  The trees for adverb anchored modifiers are very similar in 
form to the adjective anchored modifier trees.  Examples of two of the basic 
adverb modifier trees are shown in Figure~\ref{adv-trees}.

\newpage 
 
Like the adjective anchored trees, these trees also have the NA 
constraint on the foot node to restrict the number of derivations 
produced for a sequence of adverbs.  Features of the modified category 
are passed from the foot node to the root node, reflecting correctly 
that these types of properties are unaffected by the adjunction of an 
adverb.  A summary of the categories modified and the position of 
adverbs is given in Table \ref{adv-summary}.

In the English XTAG grammar, no traces are posited for wh-adverbs, in-line with 
the base-generation approach (\cite{Ernst84}) for various positions of 
adverbs. Since convincing arguments have been made against traces for adjuncts 
of other types (e.g. \cite{Baltin}), and since the reasons for wanting traces 
do not seem to apply to adjuncts, we make the general assumption in our grammar 
that adjuncts do not leave traces.  Sentence initial wh-adverbs select the same 
auxiliary tree used for other sentence initial adverbs ($\beta$ARBs) with the 
feature {\bf $<$wh$>$=+}.  Under this treatment, the derived tree for the 
sentence {\it How did you fall?} is as in Figure (\ref{how-did-you-fall}), with 
no trace for the adverb.

There is one more adverb modifier tree in the grammar which is not included in 
Table \ref{adv-summary}.  This tree, shown in Figure~\ref{weird-adv-tree}, has 
a complex adverb phrase and is used for wh+ two-adverb phrases that occur 
sentence initially, such as in sentence (\ref{ex:361}).  Since {\it how} is the only 
wh+ adverb, it is the only adverb that can anchor this tree. 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{how quickly did Srini fix the problem ?}\label{ex:361} 
\endsentences

 
Focus adverbs such as {\it only}, {\it even}, {\it just} and {\it at least} 
are also handled by the system.  Since the syntax allows focus adverbs to 
appear in practically any position, these adverbs select most of the trees 
listed in Table \ref{adv-summary}.  It is left up to the semantics or 
pragmatics to decide the correct scope for the focus adverb for a given 
instance.  In terms of the ability of the focus adverbs to modify at different 
levels of a noun phrase, the focus adverbs can modify either cardinal 
determiners or noun-cardinal noun phrases, and cannot modify at the level of 
noun.  The tree for adverbial modification of noun phrases is in shown 
Figure~\ref{other-adv-trees}(a). 
 
In addition to {\it at least}, the system handles the other two-word 
adverbs, {\it at most} and {\it up to}, and the three-word {\it as-as} 
adverb constructions, where an adjective substitutes between the two 
occurrences of {\it as}.  An example of a three-word {\it as-as} adverb 
is {\it as little as}.  Except for the ability of {\it at least} to 
modify many different types of constituents as noted above, the 
multi-word adverbs are restricted to modifying cardinal determiners. 
Example sentences using the trees in Figure~\ref{other-adv-trees} are 
shown in (\ref{ex:362})-(\ref{ex:366}).

\section{Locative Adverbial Phrases} 
\label{locatives} 
 
Locative adverbial phrases are multi-word adverbial modifiers whose 
meanings relate to spatial location. Locatives consist of a locative adverb 
(such as {\it ahead} or {\it downstream}) preceded by an NP, an adverb, or 
nothing, as in Examples (\ref{ex:367})--(\ref{ex:369}) respectively. The modifier as a 
whole describes a position relative to one previously 
specified in the discourse. The nature of the relation, which is usually 
a direction, is specified by the anchoring locative adverb({\em behind, east}). If an NP or a second adverb is present in the phrase, it specifies the 
degree of the relation (for example: {\it three city blocks, many meters,} 
and {\it far}). 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{The accident {\it three blocks ahead} stopped traffic}\label{ex:367} 
\sitem{The ship sank {\it far offshore}}\label{ex:368} 
\sitem{The trouble {\it ahead} distresses me}\label{ex:369} 
\endsentences

 
Locatives can modify NPs, VPs and Ss. They modify NPs only by right-adjoining 
post-positively, as in Example (\ref{ex:367}). Post-positive is also the more 
common position when a locative modifies either of the other categories. 
Locatives pre-modify VPs only when separated by balanced punctuation 
(commas or dashes). The trees locatives select when modifying NPs are shown 
in Figure~\ref{loc-np-trees}.

\label{loc-np-trees}

When the locative phrase consists of only the anchoring locative adverb, as in 
Example (\ref{ex:368}), it uses the $\beta$nxARB tree, shown in 
Figure~\ref{loc-np-trees}, and its VP analogue, $\beta$vxARB. In 
addition, these are the trees selected when the locative anchor is 
modified by an adverb expressing degree, as in Example \ref{ex:368}. The 
degree adverb adjoins on to the anchor using the $\beta$ARBarb tree, 
which is described in Section~\ref{adv-modifier}. Figure~\ref{toupees} 
shows an example of these trees in action. 
 
%Though there is a tree 
%for a pre-sentential locative phrase, $\beta$nxARBs, there is no 
%corresponding post-sentential tree, as it is highly debatable whether 
%the post-sentential version actually has the entire sentence or just 
%the preceding verb phrase as its scope. Thus, in accordance with XTAG 
%practice, which considers ambiguous post-sentential modifiers to be 
%VP-modifiers rather than S-modifiers, there is only a $\beta$vxnxARB 
%tree, as shown in Figure~\ref{toupees}.

One possible analysis of locative phrases with NPs might maintain that 
the NP is the head, with the locative adverb modifying the NP. This is 
initially attractive because of the similarity to time NPs, which also 
feature NPs that can modify clauses. This analysis seems insufficient, 
however, in light of the fact that virtually any NP can occur in 
locative phrases, as in example (\ref{ex:370}). Therefore, in the XTAG analysis 
the locative adverb anchors the locative phrase trees. A complete summary 
of all trees selected by locatives is contained in Table~\ref{loc-summary}. 
26\footnote{Though nearly all of these adverbs are spatial in nature, this number also includes a few temporal adverbs, such as {\it ago}, that also select these trees.} adverbs select the locative trees.
