\chapter{Gerund NP's} 
\label{gerunds-chapter} 
 
There are two types of gerunds identified in the linguistics 
literature. One is the class of {\it derived nominalizations} (also 
called {\it nominal gerundives} or {\it action nominalizations}) 
exemplified in (\ref{ex:268}), which instantiates the direct object within an 
{\it of} PP. 
The other is the class of so-called {\it sentential} or 
{\it VP gerundives} exemplified in (\ref{ex:269}). In the English XTAG grammar, 
the derived nominalizations are termed {\bf determiner gerunds}, and the 
sentential or VP gerunds are termed {\bf NP gerunds}. 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Some think that {\bf the selling of bonds} is beneficial.}\label{ex:268} 
\endsentences

 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Are private markets approving of {\bf Washington bashing Wall Street}?}\label{ex:269} 
\endsentences

 
Both types of gerunds exhibit a similar distribution, appearing in most 
places where NP's are allowed.\footnote{an exception being the NP positions in ``equative BE'' sentences, such as, {\it John is my father}.}  The bold 
face portions of sentences (\ref{ex:270})--(\ref{ex:272}) show examples of gerunds as a 
subject and as the object of a preposition. 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{{\bf Avoiding such losses} will take a monumental effort.}\label{ex:270} 
\sitem{{\bf Mr. Nolen's wandering} doesn't make him a weirdo.}\label{ex:271} 
\sitem{Are private markets approving of {\bf Washington bashing Wall Street}?}\label{ex:272} 
\endsentences

 
The motivation for splitting the gerunds into two classes is semantic as 
well as structural in nature. Semantically, the two gerunds are in sharp 
contrast with each other. NP gerunds refer to an action, i.e., a way of 
doing something, whereas determiner gerunds refer to a fact. Structurally, 
there are a number of properties (extensively discussed in \cite{Lees60}) 
that show that NP gerunds have the syntax of verbs, whereas determiner 
gerunds have the syntax of basic nouns.  Firstly, the fact that the direct 
object of the determiner gerund can only appear within an {\it of} PP 
suggests that the determiner gerund, like nouns, is not a case assigner and 
needs insertion of the preposition {\it of} for assignment of case to the 
direct object. NP gerunds, like verbs, need no such insertion and can 
assign case to their direct object.  Secondly, like nouns, only determiner 
gerunds can appear with articles (cf. example (\ref{ex:273}) and 
(\ref{ex:274})). Thirdly, determiner gerunds, like nouns, can be modified by 
adjectives (cf. example (\ref{ex:275})), whereas NP gerunds, like verbs, resist 
such modification (cf. example (\ref{ex:276})). Fourthly, nouns, unlike verbs, 
cannot co-occur with aspect (cf. example (\ref{ex:277}) and (\ref{ex:278})). Finally, 
only NP gerunds, like verbs, can take adverbial modification (cf. example 
(\ref{ex:279}) and (\ref{ex:280})).

\sitem{* \ldots the proving the theorem\ldots. \hspace{1.0in} (NP ger with article)}\label{ex:274} 
\sitem{John's rapid writing of the book\ldots. \hspace{1.0in} (det ger with Adj)}\label{ex:275} 
\sitem{* John's rapid writing the book\ldots. \hspace{1.0in} (NP ger with Adj)}\label{ex:276} 
\sitem{* John's having written of the book\ldots. \hspace{1.0in} (det ger with aspect)}\label{ex:277} 
\sitem{John having written the book\ldots. \hspace{1.0in} (NP ger with aspect)}\label{ex:278} 
\sitem{* His writing of the book rapidly\ldots. \hspace{1.0in} (det ger with Adverb)}\label{ex:279} 
\sitem{His writing the book rapidly\ldots. \hspace{1.0in} (NP ger with Adverb)}\label{ex:280} 
\endsentences

 
In English XTAG, the two types of gerunds are assigned separate 
trees within each tree family, but in order to capture their similar 
distributional behavior, both are assigned NP as the category label of 
their top node. The feature {\bf gerund = +/--} distinguishes gerund NP's from 
regular NP's where needed.\footnote{This feature is also needed to restrict the selection of gerunds in NP positions. For example, the subject and object NP's in the ``equative BE'' tree (Tnx0BEnx1) cannot be filled by gerunds, and are therefore assigned the feature {\bf gerund = --}, which prevents gerunds (which have the feature {\bf gerund = +}) from substituting into these NP positions.} The determiner gerund 
and the NP gerund trees are discussed in section~(\ref{detger-sec}) and 
~(\ref{NPger-sec}) respectively. 
 
\section{Determiner Gerunds} 
\label{detger-sec} 
The determiner gerund tree in Figure~\ref{detgerund-tree} is anchored by a 
V, capturing the fact that the gerund is derived from a verb. The verb 
projects an N and instantiates the direct object as an {\it of} PP. The 
nominal category projected by the verb can now display all the syntactic 
properties of basic nouns, as discussed above. For example, it can be 
straightforwardly modified by adjectives; it cannot co-occur with aspect; 
and it can appear with articles. The only difference of the determiner 
gerund nominal with the basic nominals is that the former cannot occur 
without the determiner, whereas the latter can. The determiner gerund 
tree therefore has an initial D modifying the N.\footnote{Note that the determiner can adjoin to the gerund only from {\it within} the gerund tree. Adjunction of determiners to the gerund root node is prevented by constraining determiners to only select NP's with the feature {\bf gerund = --}. This rules out sentences like {\it Private markets approved of (*the) [the selling of bonds]}.} It is used for gerunds such as the ones in bold face 
in sentences (\ref{ex:281}), (\ref{ex:282}) and (\ref{ex:283}).

The D node can take a simple determiner (cf. example (\ref{ex:281})), a 
genitive pronoun (cf. example (\ref{ex:282})), or a genitive NP (cf. example 
(\ref{ex:283})).\footnote{The trees for genitive pronouns and genitive NP's have the root node labelled as D because they seem to function as determiners and as such, sequence with the rest of the determiners. See Chapter~\ref{det-comparitives} for discussion on determiner trees.}

%(\ref{ex:284})). Adjectival modification would not have been possible if

\section{NP Gerunds} 
\label{NPger-sec} 
NP gerunds show a number of structural peculiarities, the crucial one being 
that they have the internal properties of sentences. In the English XTAG 
grammar, we adopt a position similar to that of \cite{Rosenbaum67} and 
\cite{Emonds70} -- that these gerunds are NP's exhaustively dominating a 
clause. Consequently, the tree assigned to the transitive NP gerund tree 
(cf. Figure~\ref{NPgerund-tree}) looks exactly like the declarative 
transitive tree for clauses except for the root node label and the feature 
values. The anchoring verb projects a VP. Auxiliary adjunction is allowed, 
subject to one constraint -- that the highest verb in the verbal sequence 
be in gerundive form, regardless of whether it is a main or auxiliary verb. 
This constraint is implemented by requiring the topmost VP node to be {\bf $<$mode$>$ = ger}. In the absence of any adjunction, the anchoring verb 
itself is forced to be gerundive. But if the verbal sequence has more than 
one verb, then the sequence and form of the verbs is limited by the 
restrictions that each verb in the sequence imposes on the succeeding 
verb. The nature of these restrictions for sentential clauses, and the 
manner in which they are implemented in XTAG, are both discussed in 
Chapter~\ref{auxiliaries}. The analysis and implementation discussed there 
differs from that required for gerunds only in one respect -- that the 
highest verb in the verbal sequence is required to be {\bf $<$mode$>$ = ger}.

\label{2;13,1} 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
 
 
Additionally, the subject in the NP gerund tree is required to have {\bf $<$case$>$=acc/none/gen}, i.e., it can be either a PRO (cf. example 
\ref{ex:284}), a genitive NP (cf. example \ref{ex:285}), or an accusative NP 
(cf. example \ref{ex:286}). The whole NP formed by the gerund can occur in either 
nominative or accusative positions. 
 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{\ldots John does not like {\bf wearing a hat}.}\label{ex:284} 
\sitem{Are private markets approving of {\bf Washington's bashing Wall Street}?}\label{ex:285} 
\sitem{Mother disapproved of {\bf me wearing such casual clothes}.}\label{ex:286} 
\endsentences

 
One question that arises with respect to gerunds is whether there is anything 
special about their distribution as compared to other types of NP's.  In fact, 
it appears that gerund NP's can occur in any NP position.  Some verbs might not 
seem to be very accepting of gerund NP arguments, as in (\ref{ex:287}) below, but we 
believe this to be a semantic incompatibility rather than a syntactic problem 
since the same structures are possible with other lexical items. 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{? [$_{NP}$John's tinkering$_{NP}$] ran.}\label{ex:287} 
\sitem{[$_{NP}$John's tinkering$_{NP}$] worked.}\label{ex:288} 
\endsentences

 
By having the root node of gerund trees be NP, the gerunds have the same 
distribution as any other NP in the English XTAG grammar without doing 
anything exceptional. The clause structure is captured by the form of the trees 
and by inclusion in the tree families. 
 
\section{Gerund Passives} 
 
It was mentioned above that the NP gerunds display certain clausal 
properties. It is therefore not surprising that they too have their own set 
of transformationally related structures. For example, NP gerunds allow 
passivization just like their sentential counterparts (cf. examples 
(\ref{ex:289}) and (\ref{ex:290})). 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{The lawyers objected to {\bf the slanderous book being written by John}.}\label{ex:289} 
\sitem{Susan could not forget {\bf having been embarrassed by the vicar}.}\label{ex:290} 
\endsentences

 
In the English XTAG grammar, gerund passives are treated in an almost 
exactly similar fashion to sentential passives, and are assigned separate 
trees within the appropriate tree families. The passives occur in pairs, 
one with the {\it by} phrase, and another without it. There are two feature 
restrictions imposed on the passive trees: (a) only verbs with {\bf $<$mode$>$ = ppart} (i.e., verbs with passive morphology) can be the 
anchors, and (b) the highest verb in the verb sequence is required to be 
{\bf $<$mode$>$ = ger}. The two restrictions, together, ensure the 
selection of only those sequences of auxiliary verb(s) that select {\bf $<$mode$>$ = ppart} and {\bf $<$passive$>$ = +} (such as {\it being} or 
{\it having been} but NOT {\it having}). The passive trees are assumed to 
be related to only the NP gerund trees (and not the determiner gerund 
trees), since passive structures involve movement of some object to the 
subject position (in a movement analysis). Also, like the sentential 
passives, gerund passives are found in most tree families that have a 
direct object in the declarative tree. Figure~\ref{pass-trees} shows 
the gerund passive trees for the transitive tree family.
