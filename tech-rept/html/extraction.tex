\chapter{Extraction} 
\label{extraction} 
 
The discussion in this chapter covers constructions that are analyzed 
as having wh-movement in GB, in particular, wh-questions and 
topicalization. Relative clauses, which could also be considered 
extractions, are discussed in Chapter~\ref{rel_clauses}. 
 
Extraction involves a constituent appearing in a linear position to the left of 
the clause with which it is interpreted. One clause argument position is 
empty. For example, the position filled by {\it frisbee} in the declarative in 
sentence~(\ref{ex:164}) is empty in sentence~(\ref{ex:165}). The wh-item {\it what} in 
sentence~(\ref{ex:165}) is of the same syntactic category as {\it frisbee} in 
sentence~(\ref{ex:164}) and fills the same role with respect to the 
subcategorization. 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Clove caught a frisbee.}\label{ex:164} 
\sitem{What$_{i}$ did Clove catch $\epsilon_{i}$?}\label{ex:165} 
\endsentences

 
 
The English XTAG grammar represents the connection between the extracted 
element and the empty position with co-indexing (as does GB).  The {\bf $<$trace$>$} feature is used to implement the co-indexing.  In extraction trees 
in XTAG, the `empty' position is filled with an {\it $\epsilon$}.  The 
extracted item always appears in these trees as a sister to the S$_{r}$ 
tree, with both dominated by a S$_{q}$ root node.  The S$_{r}$ subtrees in 
extraction trees have the same structure as the declarative tree in the same 
tree family.  The additional structure in extraction trees of the S$_{q}$ and 
NP nodes roughly corresponds to the CP and Spec of CP positions in GB. 
 
All sentential trees with extracted components (this does not include relative 
clause trees) are marked {\bf $<$extracted$>$=+} at the top S node, while 
sentential trees with no extracted components are marked {\bf $<$extracted$>$=--}.  Items that take embedded sentences, such as nouns, verbs 
and some prepositions can place restrictions on whether the embedded sentence 
is allowed to be extracted or not.  For instance, sentential subjects and 
sentential complements of nouns and prepositions are not allowed to be 
extracted, while certain verbs may allow extracted sentential complements and 
others may not (e.g. sentences (\ref{ex:166})-(\ref{ex:169})). 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{The jury wondered [who killed Nicole].}\label{ex:166} 
\sitem{The jury wondered [who Simpson killed].}\label{ex:167} 
\sitem{The jury thought [Simpson killed Nicole].}\label{ex:168} 
\sitem{$\ast$The jury thought [who did Simpson kill]?}\label{ex:169} 
\endsentences

The {\bf $<$extracted$>$} feature is also used to block embedded topicalization 
in infinitival complement clauses as exemplified in (\ref{ex:170}). 
\beginsentences
\sitem{* John wants [ Bill$_{i}$ [PRO to see t$_{i}$]]}\label{ex:170} 
\endsentences

Verbs such as {\em want} that take non-{\em wh} infinitival complements 
specify that the {\bf $<$extracted$>$} feature of their complement clause 
(i.e. of the foot S node) 
is {\bf --}. Clauses that involve topicalization have {\bf +} as the value 
of their {\bf $<$extracted$>$} feature (i.e. of the root S node). 
Sentences like (\ref{ex:170}) are thus ruled out.

The tree that is used to derive the embedded sentence in (\ref{ex:168}) in 
the English XTAG grammar is shown in 
Figure~\ref{alphaW1nx0Vnx1}\footnote{Features not pertaining to this   discussion have been taken out to improve readability.}.  The 
important features of extracted trees are: 
 
\begin{itemize} 
\item The subtree that has S$_{r}$ as its root is identical to the 
  declarative tree or a non-extracted passive tree, except for having 
  one NP position in the VP filled by $\epsilon$. 
 
\item The root S node is S$_{q}$, which dominates NP and S$_{r}$. 
  
\item The {\bf $<$trace$>$} feature of the $\epsilon$ filled NP is 
  co-indexed with the {\bf $<$trace$>$} feature of the NP daughter of 
  S$_{q}$. 
 
\item The {\bf $<$case$>$} and {\bf $<$agr$>$} features are passed 
  from the empty NP to the extracted NP.  This is particularly 
  important for extractions from subject NP's, since {\bf $<$case$>$} 
  can continue to be assigned from the verb to the subject NP 
  position, and from there be passed to the extracted NP. 
  
\item The {\bf $<$inv$>$} feature of S$_{r}$ is co-indexed to the {\bf     $<$wh$>$} feature of NP through the use of the {\bf $<$invlink$>$} 
  feature in order to force subject-auxiliary inversion where needed 
  (see section~\ref{topicalization} for more discussion of the {\bf     $<$inv$>$}/{\bf$<$wh$>$} co-indexing and the use of these trees 
  for topicalization). 
 
\end{itemize} 
 
 
 
\section{Topicalization and the value of the {\bf $<$inv$>$} feature} 
\label{topicalization} 
 
Our analysis of topicalization uses the same trees as wh-extraction.  For any 
NP complement position a single tree is used for both wh-questions and for 
topicalization from that position. Wh-questions have subject-auxiliary 
inversion and topicalizations do not.  This difference between the 
constructions is captured by equating the values of the S$_{r}$'s {\bf $<$inv$>$} feature and the extracted NP's {\bf $<$wh$>$} feature.  This means 
that if the extracted item is a wh-expression, as in wh-questions, the value of 
{\bf $<$inv$>$} will be {\bf +} and an inverted auxiliary will be forced to 
adjoin. If the extracted item is a non-wh, {\bf $<$inv$>$} will be {\bf --} 
and no auxiliary adjunction will occur. An additional complication is that 
inversion only occurs in matrix clauses, so the values of {\bf $<$inv$>$} and 
{\bf $<$wh$>$} should only be equated in matrix clauses and not in embedded 
clauses.  In the English XTAG grammar, appropriate equating of the {\bf $<$inv$>$} and {\bf $<$wh$>$} features is accomplished using the {\bf $<$invlink$>$} feature and a restriction imposed on the root S of a 
derivation. In particular, in extraction trees that are used for both 
wh-questions and topicalizations, the value of the {\bf $<$inv$>$} feature for 
the top of the S$_{r}$ node is co-indexed to the value of the {\bf $<$inv$>$} 
feature on the bottom of the S$_{q}$ node.  On the bottom of the S$_{q}$ node 
the {\bf $<$inv$>$} feature is co-indexed to the {\bf $<$invlink$>$} feature. 
The {\bf $<$wh$>$} feature of the extracted NP node is co-indexed to the value 
of the {\bf $<$wh$>$} feature on the bottom of S$_{q}$. The linking between the 
value of the S$_{q}$ {\bf $<$wh$>$} and the {\bf $<$invlink$>$} features is 
imposed by a condition on the final root node of a derivation (i.e. the top S 
node of a matrix clause) requires that {\bf $<$invlink$>$=$<$wh$>$}.  For 
example, the tree in Figure~\ref{alphaW1nx0Vnx1} is used to 
derive both (\ref{ex:171}) and (\ref{ex:172}). 
 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{John, I like.}\label{ex:171} 
\sitem{Who do you like?}\label{ex:172} 
\endsentences

 
For the question in (\ref{ex:172}), the extracted item {\it who} has the feature 
value {\bf $<$wh$>$=+}, so the value of the {\bf $<$inv$>$} feature on VP is 
also $+$ and an auxiliary, in this case {\it do}, is forced to adjoin.  For the 
topicalization (\ref{ex:171}) the values for {\it John}'s {\bf $<$wh$>$} feature and 
for S$_{q}$'s {\bf $<$inv$>$} feature are both {\bf --} and no auxiliary 
adjoins. 
 
 
 
\section{Extracted subjects} 
\label{subject-extraction} 
 
The extracted subject trees provide for sentences like (\ref{ex:173})-(\ref{ex:175}), 
depending on the tree family with which it is associated. 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Who left?}\label{ex:173} 
\sitem{Who wrote the paper?}\label{ex:174} 
\sitem{Who was happy?}\label{ex:175} 
\endsentences

 
Wh-questions on subjects differ from other argument extractions in 
not having subject-auxiliary inversion.  This means that in subject 
wh-questions the linear order of the constituents is the same as in 
declaratives so it is difficult to tell whether the subject has moved 
out of position or not (see \cite{heycock/kroch93gagl} for arguments 
for and against moved subject). 
 
The English XTAG treatment of subject extractions assumes the 
following: 
 
\begin{itemize} 
\item Syntactic subject topicalizations don't exist; and 
\item Subjects in wh-questions are extracted rather than in situ. 
\end{itemize} 
 
The assumption that there is no syntactic subject topicalization is reasonable 
in English since there is no convincing syntactic evidence and since the 
interpretability of subjects as topics seems to be mainly affected by discourse 
and intonational factors rather than syntactic structure. As for the assumption 
that wh-question subjects are extracted, these questions seem to have more 
similarities to other extractions than to the two cases in English that have 
been considered in situ wh: multiple wh questions and echo questions. In 
multiple wh questions such as sentence~(\ref{ex:176}), one of the wh-items is blocked 
from moving sentence initially because the first wh-item already occupies the 
location to which it would move. 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Who ate what?}\label{ex:176} 
\endsentences

 
This type of `blocking' account is not applicable to 
subject wh-questions because there is no obvious candidate to do the 
blocking.  Similarity between subject wh-questions and echo questions 
is also lacking.  At least one account of echo questions 
(\cite{hockey94}) argues that echo questions are not ordinary 
wh-questions at all, but rather focus constructions in which the 
wh-item is the focus. Clearly, this is not applicable to subject 
wh-questions. So it seems that treating subject wh-questions similarly 
to other wh-extractions is more justified than an in situ treatment. 
 
Given these assumptions, there must be separate trees in each tree family for 
subject extractions. The declarative tree cannot be used even though the linear 
order is the same because the structure is different. Since topicalizations are 
not allowed, the {\bf $<$wh$>$} feature for the extracted NP node is set in 
these trees to {\bf +}.  The lack of subject-auxiliary inversion is handled 
by the absence of the {\bf $<$invlink$>$} feature.  Without the presence of 
this feature, the {\bf $<$wh$>$} and {\bf $<$inv$>$} are never linked, so 
inversion can not occur.  Like other wh-extractions, the S$_{q}$ node is marked 
{\bf $<$extracted$>$=+} to constrain the occurrence of these trees in 
embedded sentences. The tree in Figure~\ref{alphaW0nx0V} is an example of a 
subject wh-question tree.

\section{Wh-moved NP complement} 
\label{NP-extr} 
 
Wh-questions can be formed on every NP object or indirect object that appears 
in the declarative tree or in the passive trees, as seen in sentences 
(\ref{ex:177})-(\ref{ex:182}).  A tree family will contain one tree for 
each of these possible NP complement positions. 
Figure~\ref{ditrans-extractions} shows the two extraction trees from the 
ditransitive tree family for the extraction of the direct 
(Figure~\ref{ditrans-extractions}(a)) and indirect object 
(Figure~\ref{ditrans-extractions}(b)). 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Dania asked Beth a question.}\label{ex:177} 
\sitem{Who$_{i}$ did Dania ask $\epsilon_{i}$ a question?}\label{ex:178} 
\sitem{What$_{i}$ did Dania ask Beth $\epsilon_{i}$?}\label{ex:179} 
\sitem{Beth was asked a question by Dania.}\label{ex:180} 
\sitem{Who$_{i}$ was Beth asked a question by $\epsilon_{i}$??}\label{ex:181} 
\sitem{What$_{i}$ was Beth asked $\epsilon_{i}$? by Dania?}\label{ex:182}

\section{Wh-moved object of a P} 
Wh-questions can be formed on the NP object of a complement PP as in 
sentence~(\ref{ex:183}). 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{$[$Which dog$]_{i}$ did Beth Ann give a bone to $\epsilon_{i}$?}\label{ex:183} 
\endsentences

 
The {\it by} phrases of passives behave like complements and can undergo the 
same type of extraction, as in (\ref{ex:184}). 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{$[$Which dog$]_{i}$ was the frisbee caught by $\epsilon_{i}$?}\label{ex:184} 
\endsentences

 
Tree structures for this type of sentence are very similar to those for the 
wh-extraction of NP complements discussed in section~\ref{NP-extr} and have the 
identical important features related to tree structure and trace and inversion 
features.  The tree in Figure~\ref{alphaW2nx0Vnx1pnx2} is an example of this 
type of tree.  Topicalization of NP objects of prepositions is handled the same 
way as topicalization of complement NP's.

\label{alphaW2nx0Vnx1pnx2} 
\label{2;8,4} 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
 
 
 
\section{Wh-moved PP} 
Like NP complements, PP complements can be extracted to form 
wh-questions, as in sentence (\ref{ex:185}). 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{[To which dog]$_{i}$ did Beth Ann throw the frisbee $\epsilon_{i}$?}\label{ex:185} 
\endsentences

 
As can be seen in the tree in Figure~\ref{alphapW2nx0Vnx1pnx2}, extraction of 
PP complements is very similar to extraction of NP complements from the same 
positions. 
 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
\centering 
\mbox{} 
\htmladdimg{ps/extraction-files/alphapW2nx0Vnx1pnx2.ps.gif} 
\begin{rawhtml} <dl> <dt>{Ditransitive with PP with PP extraction tree: $\alpha$pW2nx0Vnx1pnx2 <p> </dl> \end{rawhtml}
\label{alphapW2nx0Vnx1pnx2} 
\label{2;9,4} 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
 
 
The PP extraction trees differ from NP extraction trees in having a PP 
rather than an NP left daughter node under S$_{q}$ and in having the 
$\epsilon$ fill a PP rather than an NP position in the VP. In other 
respects these PP extraction structures behave like the NP extractions, 
including being used for topicalization. 
 
 
 
\section{Wh-moved S complement} 
 
Except for the node label on the extracted position, the trees for wh-questions 
on S complements look exactly like the trees for wh-questions on NP's in the 
same positions.  This is because there is no separate wh-lexical item for 
clauses in English, so the item {\it what} is ambiguous between representing a 
clause or an NP.  To illustrate this ambiguity notice that the question in 
(\ref{ex:186}) could be answered by either a clause as in (\ref{ex:187}) or an NP as in 
(\ref{ex:188}).  The extracted NP in these trees is constrained to be {\bf $<$wh$>$=+}, since sentential complements can not be topicalized. 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{What does Clove want?}\label{ex:186} 
\sitem{for Beth Ann to play frisbee with her}\label{ex:187} 
\sitem{a biscuit}\label{ex:188} 
\endsentences

%%\label{wh-s-extr} 
%%\label{2;6,10} 
%%\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
 
 
 
\section{Wh-moved Adjective complement} 
In subcategorizations that select an adjective complement, that 
complement can be questioned in a wh-question, as in sentence~(\ref{ex:189}). 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{How$_{i}$ did he feel $\epsilon_{i}$?}\label{ex:189} 
\endsentences

 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
\centering 
\mbox{} 
\htmladdimg{ps/extraction-files/alphaWA1nx0Vax1.ps.gif} 
\begin{rawhtml} <dl> <dt>{Predicative Adjective tree with extracted adjective: $\alpha$WA1nx0Vax1 <p> </dl> \end{rawhtml}
\label{wh-adj-extr} 
\label{1;7,14} 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
 
 
The tree families with adjective complements include trees for such adjective 
extractions that are very similar to the wh-extraction trees for other 
categories of complements.  The adjective position in the VP is filled by an 
{\it $\epsilon$} and the trace feature of the adjective complement and of the 
adjective daughter of S$_{q}$ are co-indexed.  The extracted adjective is 
required to be {\bf $<$wh$>$=+}\footnote{{\it How} is the only {\bf $<$wh$>$=+} adjective currently in the XTAG English grammar.}, so no 
topicalizations are allowed.  An example of this type of tree is shown in 
Figure~\ref{wh-adj-extr}.
