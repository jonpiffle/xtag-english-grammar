\chapter{Getting Around} 
 
This technical report presents the English XTAG grammar as implemented by 
the XTAG Research Group at the University of Pennsylvania.  The technical 
report is organized into four parts, plus a set of appendices.  Part 1 
contains general information about the XTAG system and some of the 
underlying mechanisms that help shape the grammar. 
Chapter~\ref{intro-FBLTAG} contains an introduction to the formalism behind 
the grammar and parser, while Chapter~\ref{overview} contains information 
about the entire XTAG system.  Linguists interested solely in the grammar 
of the XTAG system may safely skip Chapters~\ref{intro-FBLTAG} and 
\ref{overview}.  Chapter~\ref{underview} contains a description of the 
organization of the grammar as tree families and subcategorization frames, 
Chapter~\ref{case-assignment} information on some of the linguistic 
principles that underlie the XTAG grammar, including the distinction 
between complements and adjuncts, and how case is handled. 
 
The actual description of the grammar begins with Part 2, and is contained 
in the following three parts.  Parts 2 and 3 contains information on the 
verb classes and the types of trees allowed within the verb classes, 
respectively, while Part 4 contains information on trees not included in 
the verb classes (e.g.  NP's, PP's, various modifiers, etc). 
Chapter~\ref{table-intro} of Part 2 contains a table that attempts to 
provide an overview of the verb classes and tree types by providing a 
graphical indication of which tree types are allowed in which verb classes. 
This has been cross-indexed to tree figures shown in the tech report. 
Chapter~\ref{verb-classes} contains an overview of all of the verb classes 
in the XTAG grammar.  The rest of Part 2 contains more details on several 
of the more interesting verb classes, including ergatives, sentential 
subjects, sentential complements, copula, raising verbs, small clauses, 
ditransitives, ditransitives, datives, verbs selecting PP complements, 
resultatives and it-clefts. 
 
Part 3 contains information on some of the tree types that are available within 
the verb classes.  These tree types correspond to what would be transformations 
in a movement based approach.  Not all of these types of trees are contained in 
all of the verb classes.  The table (previously mentioned) in Part 2 contains a 
list of the tree types and indicates which verb classes each occurs in.  
 
Part 4 focuses on the non-verb class trees in the grammar.  NP's and 
determiners are presented in Chapter~\ref{det-comparitives}, while the 
various modifier trees are presented in Chapter~\ref{modifiers}.  Auxiliary 
verbs, which are classed separate from the verb classes, are presented in 
Chapter~\ref{auxiliaries}, while certain types of conjunctions are shown in 
Chapter~\ref{conjunction}.  The XTAG treatment of comparatives is presented 
in Chapter~\ref{compars-chapter}, and our treatment of punctuation is 
discussed in Chapter~\ref{punct-chapt}. 
 
Throughout the technical report, mention is occasionally made of changes or 
analyses that we hope to incorporate in the future. 
Appendix~\ref{future-work} details a list of these and other future work. 
The appendices also contain information on some of the nitty gritty details 
of the XTAG grammar, including a system of metarules which can be used for 
grammar development and maintenance in Appendix~\ref{metarules}. A system 
for the organization of the grammar in terms of an inheritance hierarchy is 
in Appendix~\ref{lexorg}. The tree naming conventions used in XTAG are 
explained in detail in Appendix~\ref{tree-naming}, and a comprehensive list
