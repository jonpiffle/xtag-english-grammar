 
\chapter{Punctuation Marks} 
\label{punct-chapt} 
 
Many parsers require that punctuation be stripped out of the 
input. Since punctuation is often optional, this sometimes has no 
effect. However, there are a number of constructions which must 
obligatorily contain punctuation and adding analyses of these to the 
grammar without the punctuation would lead to severe 
overgeneration. An especially common example is noun 
appositives. Without access to punctuation, one would have to allow 
every combinatorial possibility of NPs in noun sequences, which is 
clearly undesirable (especially since there is already unavoidable 
noun-noun compounding ambiguity). Aside from coverage issues, it is 
also preferable to take input ``as is'' and do as little editing as 
possible. With the addition of punctuation to the XTAG grammar, we 
need only do/assume the conversion of certain sequences of punctuation 
into the ``British'' order (this is discussed in more detail below in 
Section \ref{bal}). 
 
The XTAG POS tagger currently tags every punctuation mark as 
itself. These tags are all converted to the POS tag {\it Punct} before 
parsing. This allows us to treat the punctuation marks as a single POS 
class. They then have features which distinguish amongst them. 
Wherever possible we have the punctuation marks as anchors, to 
facilitate early filtering. 
 
The full set of punctuation marks is separated into three classes: 
balanced, separating and terminal. The balanced punctuation marks are 
quotes and parentheses, separating are commas, dashes, semi-colons and 
colons, and terminal are periods, exclamation points and question 
marks. Thus, the {\bf $<$punct$>$} feature is complex (like the {\bf $<$agr$>$} feature), yielding feature equations like {\bf $<$Punct bal = paren$>$} or {\bf $<$Punct term = excl$>$}. Separating and terminal 
punctuation marks do not occur adjacent to other members of the same 
class, but may occasionally occur adjacent to members of the other 
class, e.g. a question mark on a clause which is separated by a dash 
from a second clause. Balanced punctuation marks are sometimes adjacent 
to one another, e.g. quotes immediately inside of parentheses. The 
{\bf $<$punct$>$} feature allows us to control these local 
interactions. 
 
We also need to control non-local interaction of punctuation 
marks. Two cases of this are so-called quote alternation, wherein 
embedded quotation marks must alternate between single and double, and 
the impossibility of embedding an item containing a colon inside of 
another item containing a colon. Thus, we have a fourth value for {\bf $<$punct$>$}, {\bf $<$contains colon/dquote/etc. +/-$>$}, which 
indicates whether or not a constituent contains a particular 
punctuation mark. This feature is percolated through all auxiliary 
trees.  Things which may not embed are: colons under colons, 
semi-colons, dashes or commas; semi-colons under semi-colon or commas. 
Although it is rare, parentheses may appear inside of parentheses, say 
with a bibliographic reference inside a parenthesized sentence. 
 
%Embedded appositives are fine:`noted Simon Briscoe, UK economist for Midland 
%Montagu, a unit of Midland Bank PLC.' 
 
%if we want to be absolutely meticulous it should be 
%percolated everywhere, since, for instance, an argument (say NP) might 
%be enclosed in single quotes and the larger constituent (say S) be 
%enclosed in a second set of quotes. We would currently not be able to 
%force the outer quotes to be double. 
 
\section{Appositives, parentheticals and vocatives} 
 
These trees handle constructions where additional lexical material is 
only licensed in conjunction with particular punctuation marks. Since 
the lexical material is unconstrained (virtually any noun can occur as 
an appositive), the punctuation marks are anchors and the other nodes 
are substitution sites. There are cases where the lexical material is 
restricted, as with parenthetical adverbs like {\it however}, and in 
those cases we have the adverb as the anchor and the punctuation marks 
as substitution sites. 
 
When these constructions can appear inside of clauses 
(non-peripherally), they must be separated by punctuation marks on 
both sides. However, when they occur peripherally they have either a 
preceding or following punctuation mark. We handle this by having 
both peripheral and non-peripheral trees for the relevant 
constructions. The alternative is to insert the second (following) 
punctuation mark in the tokenization process (i.e. insert a comma 
before the period when an appositive appears on the last NP of a 
sentence). However, this is very difficult to do accurately. 
 
\subsection{$\beta$nxPUnxPU} 
 
The symmetric (non-peripheral) tree for NP appositives, anchored by: 
comma, dash or parentheses. It is shown in Figure \ref{nxPUnxPU} anchored by 
parentheses. 
 
\beginsentences

\label{nxPUnxPU} 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
 
 
The punctuation marks are the anchors and the appositive NP is 
substituted. The appositive can be conjoined, but only with a lexical 
conjunction (not with a comma). Appositives with commas or dashes 
cannot be pronouns, although they may be conjuncts containing 
pronouns.  When used with 
parentheses this tree actually presents an alternative rather than an 
appositive, so a pronoun is possible. Finally, the appositive position 
is restricted to having nominative or accusative case to block PRO 
from appearing here. 
 
%Mickey says he has a counter-example w/stacking, something with 
%``Thomson-CSF'' 
Appositives can be embedded, as in (\ref{ex:422}), but do not seem to be 
able to stack on a single NP. In this they are more like restrictive 
relatives than appositive relatives, which typically can stack. 
 
\beginsentences

\endsentences

 
\subsection{$\beta$nPUnxPU} 
 
The symmetric (non-peripheral) tree for N-level NP appositives, is 
anchored by comma. The modifier is typically an address.  It is clear 
from examples such as (\ref{ex:423}) that these are attached at N, rather 
than NP. {\it Carrier } is not an appositive on {\it Menlo Park}, as it 
would be if these were simply stacked appositives. Rather, {\it Calif.} modifies {\it Menlo Park}, and that entire complex is 
compounded with {\it carrier}, as shown in the correct derivation in 
Figure \ref{nPUnx}. Because this distinction is less clear when the 
modifier is peripheral (e.g. ends the sentence), and it would be 
difficult to distinguish between NP and N attachment, we do not 
currently allow a peripheral N-level attachment.

\subsection{$\beta$nxPUnx} 
 
This tree, which can be anchored by a comma, dash or colon, handles 
asymmetric (peripheral) NP appositives and NP colon expansions of 
NPs. Figure \ref{nxPUnx} shows this tree anchored by a dash and a 
colon. Like the symmetric appositive tree, $\beta$nxPUnxpu, the 
asymmetric appositive cannot be a pronoun, while the colon expansion 
can. Thus, this constraint comes from the syntactic entry in both 
cases rather than being built into the tree.

The colon expansion cannot itself contain a colon, so the foot $S$ has the

\subsection{$\beta$PUpxPUvx}

\sitem{Mary , just within the last year , has totalled two cars}\label{ex:430}

These are clearly not NP modifiers.

\subsection{$\beta$puARBpuvx} 
\label{par-adverb} 
 
Parenthetical adverbs - {\it however}, {\it though}, etc. Since the 
class of adverbs is highly restricted, this tree is anchored by the 
adverb and the punctuation marks substitute.  The punctuation marks 
may be either commas or dashes.  Like the parenthetical PP above, 
these are clearly not NP modifiers.

\subsection{$\beta$sPUnx} 
 
Sentence final vocative, anchored by comma:  
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{You were there , Stanley/my boy .}\label{ex:432} 
\endsentences

 
Also, when anchored by colon, NP expansion on S. These often appear to 
be extraposed modifiers of some internal NP. The NP must be quite 
heavy, and is usually a list: 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Of the major expansions in 1960, three were financed under the R. I. Industrial Building Authority's 100\% guaranteed mortgage plan: Collyer Wire, Leesona Corporation, and American Tube \& Controls.}\label{ex:433} 
\endsentences

 
A simplified version of this sentence is shown in figure 
\ref{sPUnx}. The NP cannot be a pronoun in either of these cases. 
Both vocatives and colon expansions are restricted to appear on tensed 
clauses (indicative or imperative).

The noun phrase may be anything but a pronoun, although it is most 
commonly a proper noun. The clause adjoined to must be indicative or 
imperative. 
 
\section{Bracketing punctuation} 
\label{bal} 
 
\subsection{Simple bracketing} 
 
Trees: $\beta$PUsPU, $\beta$PUnxPU, $\beta$PUnPU, $\beta$PUvxPU, $\beta$PUvPU, 
$\beta$PUarbPU, $\beta$PUaPU, $\beta$PUdPU, $\beta$PUpxPU, 
$\beta$PUpPU 
 
\noindent 
These trees are selected by parentheses and quotes and can adjoin onto 
any node type, whether a head or a phrasal constituent.  This handles 
things in parentheses or quotes which are syntactically integrated 
into the surrounding context. Figure \ref{bal-trees} shows the $\beta$PUsPU 
anchored by parentheses, and this tree along with $\beta$PUnxPU in a 
derived tree. 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Dick Carroll and his accordion (which we now refer to as ``Freida'') held over at Bahia Cabana where ``Sir'' Judson Smith brings in his calypso capers Oct. 13 .\hfill [Brown:ca31]}\label{ex:435} 
\endsentences

 
\beginsentences
\sitem{...noted that the term ``teacher-employee'' (as opposed to, e.g., ``maintenance employee'') was a not inapt description. \hfill [Brown:ca35]}\label{ex:436} 
\endsentences

 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}

\begin{rawhtml} <dl> <dt>{$\beta$PUsPU anchored by parentheses, and in a derivation, along with  $\beta$PUnxPU <p> </dl> \end{rawhtml}
\label{bal-trees} 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
 
There is a convention in English that quotes embedded in quotes 
alternate between single and double; in American English the outermost 
are double quotes, while in British English they are single.  The {\bf contains} feature is used to control this alternation. The trees 
anchored by double quotation marks have the feature {\bf punct contains dquote = -} on the foot node and the feature {\bf punct contains dquote = +} on the root. All adjunction trees are transparent 
to the {\bf contains} feature, so if any tree below the double 
quote is itself enclosed in double quotes the derivation will 
fail. Likewise with the trees anchored by single quotes. The quote 
trees in effect ``toggle'' the {\bf contains Xquote} 
feature. Immediate proximity is handled by the {\bf punct balanced} 
feature, which allows quotes inside of parentheses, but not vice-versa. 
 
In addition, American English typically places/moves periods (and 
commas) inside of quotation marks when they would logically occur 
outside, as in example 
\ref{ex:437}. The comma in the first part of the quote is not part of the 
quote, but rather part of the parenthetical quoting clause. However, 
by convention it is shifted inside the quote, as is the final 
period. British English does not do this. We assume here that the 
input has already been tokenized into the ``British'' format. 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{``You can't do this to us ,'' Diane screamed .  ``We are Americans.''}\label{ex:437} 
\endsentences

 
The $\beta$PUsPU can handle quotation marks around multiple sentences, 
since the sPUs tree allows us to join two sentences with a period, 
exclamation point or question mark. Currently, however, we cannot 
handle the style where only an open quote appears at the beginning of 
a paragraph when the quotation extends over multiple 
paragraphs. We could allow a lone open quote to select the $\beta$PUs 
tree, if this is deemed desirable. 
 
Also, the $\beta$PUsPU is selected by a pair of commas to handle 
non-peripheral appositive relative clauses, such as in example 
(\ref{ex:438}). Restrictive and appositive relative clauses are not 
syntactically differentiated in the XTAG grammar 
(cf. Chapter \ref{rel_clauses}). 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{This news , announced by Jerome Toobin , the orchestra's administrative director , brought applause ...  [Brown:cc09]}\label{ex:438} 
\endsentences

 
The trees discussed in this section will only allow balanced 
punctuation marks to adjoin to constituents. We will not get them 
around non-constituents, as in (\ref{ex:439}). 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Mary asked him to leave (and  he left)}\label{ex:439} 
\endsentences

 
\subsection{$\beta$sPUsPU} 
 
This tree allows a parenthesized clause to adjoin onto a 
non-parenthesized clause. 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Innumerable motels from Tucson to New York boast swimming pools ( `` swim at your own risk '' is the hospitable sign poised at the brink of most pools ) . \hfill [Brown:ca17]}\label{ex:440} 
\endsentences

 
\section{Punctuation trees containing no lexical material} 
 
\subsection{$\alpha$PU} 
 
This is the elementary tree for substitution of punctuation 
marks. This tree is used in the quoted speech trees, where including 
the punctuation mark as an anchor along with the verb of saying would 
require a new entry for every tree selecting the relevant tree 
families. It is also used in the tree for parenthetical adverbs 
($\beta$puARBpuvx), and for S-adjoined PPs and adverbs ($\beta$spuARB 
and $\beta$spuPnx). 
 
\subsection{$\beta$PUs} 
 
Anchored by comma: allows comma-separated clause initial adjuncts, 
(\ref{ex:441}-\ref{ex:442}). 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Here , as in ``Journal'' , Mr. Louis has given himself the lion's share of the dancing... \hfill [Brown:cc09]}\label{ex:441} 
\endsentences

 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Choreographed by Mr. Nagrin, the work filled the second half of a program}\label{ex:442} 
\endsentences

 
To keep this tree from appearing on root Ss (i.e. {\it , sentence}), 
we have a root constraint that {\bf $<$punct struct = nil$>$} (similar 
to the requirement that root Ss be tensed, i.e. {\bf $<$mode~=~ind/imp$>$}).  The {\bf $<$punct struct$>$ = nil} feature on the foot 
blocks stacking of multiple punctuation marks. This feature is shown 
in the tree in Figure \ref{PUs}. 
 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
\centering 
\hspace{0.0in} 
\htmladdimg{ps/punct-files/PUs.ps.gif} 
\begin{rawhtml} <dl> <dt>{$\beta$PUs, with features displayed <p> </dl> \end{rawhtml}
\label{PUs} 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
 
This tree can be also used by adjuncts on embedded clauses: 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{One might expect that in a poetic career of seventy-odd years, some changes in style and method would have occurred, some development taken place. \hfill [Brown:cj65]}\label{ex:443} 
\endsentences

 
These adjuncts sometimes have commas on both sides of the adjunct, or, 
like (\ref{ex:443}), only have them at the end of the adjunct. 
 
Finally, this tree is also used for peripheral appositive relative 
clauses. 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Interest may remain limited into tomorrow's U.K. trade figures, which the market will be watching closely to see if there is any improvement after disappointing numbers in the previous two months.}\label{ex:444} 
\endsentences

 
%Don't need to block BELOW comps: Mary said that, in her experience, 
%cats sleep a lot.  Don't want comp=nil on bottom of foot, because 
%this would block "his explanation was this: that he couldn't stay in 
%his present job\", or sub-conj=nil there bec it blocks \"Mary 
%sneezed, because Bill blew pepper in her face\". 
 
\subsection{$\beta$sPUs} 
\label{sPUs} 
 
This tree handles clausal ``coordination'' with comma, dash, colon, 
semi-colon or any of the terminal punctuation marks. The first clause 
must be either indicative or imperative. The second may also be 
infinitival with the separating punctuation marks, but must be 
indicative or imperative with the terminal marks; with a comma, it may 
only be indicative. The two clauses need not share the same mode. NB: 
Allowing the terminal punctuation marks to anchor this tree allows us 
to parse sequences of multiple sentences. This is not the usual mode 
of parsing; if it were, this sort of sequencing might be better 
handled by a higher level of processing. 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{For critics , Hardy has had no poetic periods -- one does not speak of early Hardy or late Hardy , or of the London or Max Gate period....}\label{ex:445} 
\endsentences

 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Then there was exercise , boating and hiking , which was not only good for you but also made you more virile : the thought of strenuous activity left him exhausted.}\label{ex:446} 
\endsentences

 
This construction is one of the few where two non-bracketing 
punctuation marks can be adjacent. It is possible (if rare) for the 
first clause to end with a question mark or exclamation point, when 
the two clauses are conjoined with a semi-colon, colon or 
dash. Features on the foot node, as shown in Figure \ref{sPUs-tree}, control 
this interaction.

%**Do I want to allow ambiguous scopes here? Or force right-branching? 
 
\subsection{$\beta$sPU} 
 
This tree handles the sentence final punctuation marks when selected 
by a question mark, exclamation point or period. One could also 
require a final punctuation mark for all clauses, but such an approach 
would not allow non-periods to occur internally, for instance before a 
semi-colon or dash as noted above in Section \ref{sPUs}. This tree 
currently only adjoins to indicative or imperative (root) clauses. 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{He left !}\label{ex:449} 
\sitem{Get lost .}\label{ex:450} 
\sitem{Get lost ?}\label{ex:451} 
\endsentences

 
The feature {\bf punct bal= nil} on the foot node ensures that this 
tree only adjoins inside of parentheses or quotes completely enclosing 
a sentence (\ref{ex:452}), but does not restrict it from adjoining to clause 
which ends with balanced punctuation if only the end of the clause is 
contained in the parentheses or quotes (\ref{ex:453}). 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{(John then left .)}\label{ex:452} 
\sitem{(John then left) .}\label{ex:453} 
\sitem{Mary asked him to leave (immediately) .}\label{ex:454} 
\endsentences

 
This tree is also selected by the colon to handle a colon expansion 
after adjunct clause -- 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Expressed differently : if the price for becoming a faithful follower... \hfill [Brown:cd02]}\label{ex:455} 
\endsentences

 
\beginsentences

\endsentences

 
\beginsentences
\sitem{To express it differently : if the price for becoming a faithful follower... \hfill [Brown:cd02]}\label{ex:457} 
\endsentences

 
This tree is only used after adjunct (untensed) clauses, which adjoin 
to the tensed clause using the adjunct clause trees (cf Section 
\ref{adjunct-cls} ); the {\bf mode} of the complete clause is that of 
the matrix rather than the adjunct. Indicative or imperative 
(i.e. root) clauses separated by a colon use the $\beta$sPUs tree 
(Section \ref{sPUs}). 
 
\subsection{$\beta$vPU} 
 
%PROB: get adjunction at e in pred trees. Laura will fix. 
 
This tree is anchored by a colon or a dash, and occurs between a verb 
and its complement. These typically are lists. 
 
\beginsentences

\subsection{$\beta$pPU} 
 
This tree is anchored by a colon or a dash, and occurs between a 
preposition and its complement. It typically occurs with a sequence 
of complements. As with the tree above, this typically occurs with a 
conjoined complement. 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{...and utilization such as : (A) the protection of forage...}\label{ex:459} 
\sitem{...can be represented as : Af.}\label{ex:460} 
\endsentences

 
\section{Other trees} 
 
\subsection{$\beta$spuARB} 
\label{post-adverb} 
 
In general, we attach post-clausal modifiers at the VP node, as you 
typically get scope ambiguity effects with negation ({\it John didn't leave today} -- did he leave or not?). However, with post-sentential, 
comma-separated adverbs, there is no ambiguity - in {\it John didn't leave, today} he definitely did not leave. Since this tree is only 
selected by a subset of the adverbs (namely, those which can appear 
pre-sententially, without a punctuation mark), it is anchored by the 
adverb.
