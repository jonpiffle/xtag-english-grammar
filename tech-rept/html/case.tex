\section{Approaches to Case} 
\subsection{Case in GB theory} 
 
GB (Government and Binding) theory proposes the following 
`case filter' as a requirement on S-structure.\footnote{There are certain problems with applying the case filter as a requirement at the level of S-structure.  These issues are not crucial to the discussion of the English XTAG implementation of case and so will not be discussed here.  Interested readers are referred to \cite{lasnik-uriagereka88}.} 
 
\begin{verse} 
\xtagdef{Case Filter:} 
Every overt NP must be assigned abstract case. \cite{haegeman91} 
\end{verse} 
 
Abstract case is taken to be universal.  Languages with rich morphological case 
marking, such as Latin, and languages with very limited morphological case 
marking, like English, are all presumed to have full systems of abstract case 
that differ only in the extent of morphological realization. 
 
In GB, abstract case is argued to be assigned to NP's by various case 
assigners, namely verbs, prepositions, and INFL.  Verbs and 
prepositions are said to assign accusative case to NP's that they 
govern, and INFL assigns nominative case to NP's that it governs. 
These governing categories are constrained as to where they can assign 
case by means of `barriers' based on `minimality conditions', although 
these are relaxed in `exceptional case marking' situations.  The 
details of the GB analysis are beyond the scope of this technical 
report, but see \cite{chomsky86} for the original analysis or 
\cite{haegeman91} for an overview.  Let it suffice for us to say that 
the notion of abstract case and the case filter are useful in 
accounting for a number of phenomena including the distribution of 
nominative and accusative case, and the distribution of overt NP's and 
empty categories (such as PRO). 
 
\subsection{Minimalism and Case} 
 
A major conceptual difference between GB theories and Minimalism is that in 
Minimalism, lexical items carry their features with them rather than being 
assigned their features based on the nodes where they end up.  For nouns, 
this means that they carry case with them, and that their case is `checked' 
when they are in SPEC position of AGR$_s$ or AGR$_o$, which subsequently 
disappears \cite{chomsky92}. 
 
\section{Case in XTAG} 
 
The English XTAG grammar adopts the notion of case and the case filter for many 
of the same reasons argued in the GB literature.  However, in some respects the 
English XTAG grammar's implementation of case more closely resembles the 
treatment in Chomsky's Minimalism framework \cite{chomsky92} than the system 
outlined in the GB literature \cite{chomsky86}.  As in Minimalism, nouns in 
the XTAG grammar carry case with them, which is eventually `checked'. However, 
in the XTAG grammar, noun cases are checked against the case values assigned 
by the verb during the unification of the feature structures.  Unlike Chomsky's 
Minimalism, there are no separate AGR nodes; the case checking comes from the 
verbs directly. Case assignment from the verb is more like the GB approach than 
the requirement of a SPEC-head relationship in Minimalism. 
 
Most nouns in English do not have separate forms for nominative and accusative 
case, and so they are ambiguous between the two.  Pronouns, of course, are 
morphologically marked for case, and each carries the appropriate case in its 
feature.  Figures~\ref{nouns-with-case}(a) and \ref{nouns-with-case}(b) show 
the NP tree anchored by a noun and a pronoun, respectively, along with the 
feature values associated with each word.  Note that {\it books} simply gets 
the default case {\bf nom/acc}, while {\it she} restricts the case to be {\bf nom}.

\section{Case Assigners} 
 
Case is assigned in the XTAG English grammar by two lexical categories 
- verbs and prepositions.\footnote{{\it For} also assigns case as a complementizer.  See section \ref{for-complementizer} for more details.} 
 
\subsection{Prepositions} 
\label{prep-case} 
 
Prepositions assign accusative case ({\bf acc}) through 
their {\bf $<$assign-case$>$} feature, which is linked directly to the 
{\bf $<$case$>$} feature of their objects. 
Figure~\ref{PXPnx-with-case}(a) shows a lexicalized preposition tree, 
while Figure~\ref{PXPnx-with-case}(b) shows the same tree with the NP 
tree from Figure~\ref{nouns-with-case}(a) substituted into the NP 
position.  Figure~\ref{PXPnx-with-case}(c) is the tree in 
Figure~\ref{PXPnx-with-case}(b) after unification has taken place. 
Note that the case ambiguity of {\it books} has been resolved to 
accusative case.

\subsection{Verbs} 
\label{case-for-verbs} 
Verbs are the other part of speech in the XTAG grammar that can assign case. 
Because XTAG does not distinguish INFL and VP nodes, verbs must provide case 
assignment on the subject position in addition to the case assigned to their NP 
complements. 
 
Assigning case to NP complements is handled by building the case values of the 
complements directly into the tree that the case assigner (the verb) anchors. 
Figures~\ref{S-tree-with-case}(a) and \ref{S-tree-with-case}(b) show an S 
tree\footnote{Features not pertaining to this discussion have been taken out to improve readability and to make the trees easier to fit onto the page.} that 
would be anchored\footnote{The diamond marker ($\diamond$) indicates the anchor(s) of a structure if the tree has not yet been lexicalized.} by a 
transitive and ditransitive verb, respectively.  Note that the case assignments 
for the NP complements are already in the tree, even though there is not yet a 
lexical item anchoring the tree.  Since every verb that selects these trees 
(and other trees in each respective subcategorization frame) assigns the same 
case to the complements, building case features into the tree has exactly the 
same result as putting the case feature value in each verb's lexical entry.

The case assigned to the subject position varies with verb form.  Since the 
XTAG grammar treats the inflected verb as a single unit rather than dividing it 
into INFL and V nodes, case, along with tense and agreement, is expressed in 
the features of verbs, and must be passed in the appropriate manner.  The trees 
in Figure~\ref{lexicalized-S-tree-with-case} show the path of linkages that 
joins the {\bf$<$assign-case$>$} feature of the V to the {\bf $<$case$>$} 
feature of the subject NP.  The morphological form of the verb determines the 
value of the {\bf $<$assign-case$>$} feature. 
Figures~\ref{lexicalized-S-tree-with-case}(a) and 
\ref{lexicalized-S-tree-with-case}(b) show the same tree\footnote{Again, the feature structures shown have been restricted to those that pertain to the V/NP interaction.} anchored by different morphological forms of the verb {\it sing}, 
which give different values for the {\bf $<$assign-case$>$} feature. 
Tensed verbs assign case {\bf nom}, whereas non-tensed verbs assign no case at 
all; that is, a verb such as {\it singing} has no {\bf $<$assign-case$>$} 
feature.

\label{Vvx-with-case} 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
 
In the case of a tenseless verb, a tensed auxiliary will adjoin in and assign 
case to the subject, or the subject will be assigned accusative from a higher 
ECM verb.\footnote{Currently, there is no such thing in the grammar as a {\it Case Filter} that will rule out sentences with nouns that are not receiving case. Thus, sentences such as {\it$\ast$ I hope Carlos to be happy} are accepted, even though the NP {\it Carlos} does not receive case. We are exploring other ways of handling this for future releases.} 
%When we fix this we can say ``Thus, sentences such as {\it I hope Carlos to be %happy} are not ruled out by case, but rather by another mechanism. This is 
%discussed in section...'' 
 
 
 
%The adjunction of an auxiliary verb onto the VP node breaks the {\bf %$<$assign-case$>$} link from the main V, replacing it with a link from the 
%auxiliary verb instead.\footnote{See section \ref{aux-non-inverted} for a more %complete explanation of how this relinking occurs.} The progressive form of the 
%verb in Figure~\ref{lexicalized-S-tree-with-case}(b) has the feature-value {\bf %$<$assign-case$>$=none}, but this is overridden by the adjunction of the 
%appropriate form of the auxiliary word {\it be}.  Figure~\ref{Vvx-with-case}(a) 
%shows the lexicalized auxiliary tree, while Figure~\ref{Vvx-with-case}(b) shows 
%it adjoined into the transitive tree shown in 
%Figure~\ref{lexicalized-S-tree-with-case}(b).  The case value passed to the 
%subject NP is now {\bf nom} (nominative). 
 
 
\section{PRO} 
 
In GB theory, the null NP element PRO can only appear in positions where it 
does not receive case (and in fact, where it is ungoverned). PRO only appears 
in subject position of tenseless (non-matrix) clauses, where the clause is 
either an adjunct, as in \ref{ex:46}, or a CP infinitival complement clause, as in 
\ref{ex:47}. Since only tensed verbs can assign nominative case, a PRO in the 
subject position of a tenseless clause will not receive nominative case. PRO 
also cannot appear in the complement of an ECM verb, since ECM verbs assign 
accusative case to the subject of their complement clause. 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{While PRO talking to Anoop, Carlos drank a coke.}\label{ex:46} 
\sitem{Tonia wants PRO to eat lunch.}\label{ex:47} 
\endsentences

 
In previous versions of the grammar, the distribution of PRO was controlled by 
case features, similar to its treatment GB theory. PRO anchored an NP initial 
tree and had the feature case {\bf none}. This tree could substitute into NP 
positions, but only unify in a position where either case {\bf none} or no case 
at all was assigned, but not in positions with case {\bf nom} or {\bf acc}. 
 
Currently, however, we have dispensed with the non-lexicalized PRO tree, and 
tenseless verbs no longer have the 
feature {\bf $<$assign-case$>$none}. Rather than substituting in, PRO 
is built into the subject position of the relevant sentential (and gerund) 
trees.\footnote{In this, we follow the treatment of PRO in the French XTAG project \cite{ACK00}.} \footnote{Note that, as of the Fall 2000 release, not all the PRO trees had been included in the grammar. Thus, some necessary trees are missing.} 
 
The distribution of PRO is still controlled by case features to some degree, 
however. The trees with PRO built-in have an {\bf $<$assign-case$>$none} 
feature in the root S node (rather than being assigned by the verb). By having 
this feature, we can make sure that the PRO tree cannot appear as the 
complement of an ECM verb, since it will clash with the ECM verb's {\bf $<$assign-case$>$acc} feature. 
 
%include tree here?? 
 
%Tensed forms of a verb assign nominative case, and untensed forms 
%assign case {\bf none}, as the progressive form of the verb {\it sing} 
%does in Figure~\ref{lexicalized-S-tree-with-case}(b). This is 
%different than assigning no case at all, as one form of the infinitive 
%marker {\it to} does. See Section~\ref{for-complementizer} for more 
%discussion of this special case.) The distinction of a case {\bf none} 
%from no case is indicative of a divergence from the standard GB 
%theory.  In GB theory, the absence of case on an NP means that only 
%PRO can fill that NP.  With feature unification as is used in the 
%FB-LTAG grammar, the absence of case on an NP means that {\em any\/} 
%NP can fill it, regardless of its case.  This is due to the mechanism 
%of unification, in which if something is unspecified, it can unify 
%with anything.  Thus we have a specific case {\bf none} to handle verb 
%forms that in GB theory do not assign case.  PRO is the only NP with 
%case {\bf none}.  Note that although we are drawn to this treatment by 
%our use of unification for feature manipulation, our treatment is very 
%similar to the assignment of null case to PRO in 
%\cite{ChomskyLasnik93}.  \cite{watanabe93} also proposes a very similar 
%approach within Chomsky's Minimalist framework.\footnote{See Sections~ %\ref{PRO} and \ref{PRO-control} %for additional discussion of PRO.}
