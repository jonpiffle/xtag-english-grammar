\section{Introduction} 
 
Comparatives in English can manifest themselves in many ways, acting 
on many different grammatical categories and often involving ellipsis. 
A distinction must be made at the outset between two very different 
sorts of comparatives---those which make a comparison between two 
propositions and those which compare the extent to which an entity has 
one property to a greater or lesser extent than another property.  The 
former, which we will refer to as {\it propositional} comparatives, is 
exemplified in (\ref{ex:48}), while the latter, which we will call {\it metalinguistic} comparatives (following Hellan 1981), is seen in 
(\ref{ex:49}): 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Ronaldo is more angry than Romario.}\label{ex:48} 
\sitem{Ronaldo is more angry than upset.}\label{ex:49} 
\endsentences

 
\noindent In (\ref{ex:48}), the extent to which Ronaldo is angry is greater 
than the extent to which Romario is angry.  Sentence (\ref{ex:49}) 
indicates that the extent to which Ronaldo is angry is greater than 
the extent to which he is upset. 
 
Apart from certain of the elliptical cases, both kinds of comparatives 
can be handled straightforwardly in the XTAG system.  Elliptical cases 
which are not presently covered include those exemplified by the 
following sentences, which would presumably be handled in the same way 
as other sorts of VP ellipsis would. 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Ronaldo is more angry than Romario is.}\label{ex:50} 
\sitem{Bill eats more broccoli than George eats.}\label{ex:51} 
\sitem{Bill eats more broccoli than George does.}\label{ex:52} 
\endsentences

 
We turn to the analysis of metalinguistic comparatives first. 
 
\section{Metalinguistic Comparatives} 
 
A metalinguistic comparison can be performed on basically all of the 
predicational categories---adjectives, verb phrases, prepositional 
phrases, and nouns---as in the following examples: 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{The table is more long than wide. (AP)}\label{ex:53} 
\sitem{Clark more makes the rules than follows them. (VP)}\label{ex:54} 
\sitem{Calvin is more in the living room than in the kitchen. (PP)}\label{ex:55} 
\sitem{That unindentified amphibian in the bush is more frog than toad, I would say. (NP)}\label{ex:56} 
\endsentences

 
\noindent At present, we only deal with the adjectival metalinguistic 
comparatives as in (\ref{ex:53}).  The analysis given here for these can 
be easily extended to prepositional phrases and nominal comparatives of 
the metalinguistic sort, but, as with coordination in XTAG, verb 
phrases will prove more difficult. 
 
Adjectival comparatives appear to distribute with simple adjectives, 
as in the following examples: 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Herbert is more livid than angry.}\label{ex:57} 
\sitem{Herbert is more livid and furious than angry.}\label{ex:58} 
\sitem{The more innovative than conventional medication cured everyone in the sick ward.}\label{ex:59} 
\sitem{The elephant, more wobbly than steady, fell from the circus ball.}\label{ex:60} 
\endsentences

 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
\centering 
\begin{tabular}{cc} 
{\htmladdimg{ps/comparatives-files/betaARBaPa.ps.gif}} 
\end{tabular}\\ 
\begin{rawhtml} <dl> <dt>{Tree for Metalinguistic Adjective Comparative: $\beta$ARBaPa <p> </dl> \end{rawhtml}
\label {ARBaPa-tree} 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
 
This patterning indicates that we can give these comparatives a tree 
that adjoins quite freely onto adjectives, as in 
Figure~\ref{ARBaPa-tree}.  This tree is anchored by {\it more/less - than}.  To avoid grammatically incorrect comparisons such as {\it more brighter than dark}, the feature {\bf compar} is used to block this 
tree from adjoining onto morphologically comparative adjectives.  The 
foot node is {\bf compar-}, while {\it brighter} and its comparative 
siblings are {\bf compar+}\footnote {The analysis given later for adjectival propositional comparatives produces aggregated {\bf compar+} adjectives such as {\it more bright}, which will also be incompatible (as desired) with $\beta$ARBaPa.}.  We also wish to block 
strings like {\it more brightest than dark}, which is accomplished 
with the feature {\bf super}, indicating superlatives.  This feature 
is negative at the foot node so that $\beta$ARBaPa cannot adjoin to 
superlatives like {\it nicest}, which are specified as {\bf super+} 
from the morphology.  Furthermore, the root node is {\bf super+} so that $\beta$ARBaPa cannot adjoin onto itself and produce 
monstrosities such as (\ref{ex:61}): 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{*Herbert is more less livid than angry than furious.}\label{ex:61} 
\endsentences

 
\noindent Thus, the use of the {\bf super} feature is less to indicate 
superlativeness specifically, but rather to indicate that the subtree 
below a {\bf super+} node contains a full-fleshed comparison.  In the 
case of lexical superlatives, the comparison is against everything, 
implicitly. 
 
A benefit of the multiple-anchor approach here is that we will never 
allow sentences such as (\ref{ex:62}), which would be permissible if we 
split the comparative component and the {\it than} component of 
metalinguistic comparatives into two separate trees. 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{*Ronaldo is angrier than upset.}\label{ex:62} 
\endsentences

 
We also see another variety of adjectival comparatives of the form {\it more/less than X}, which indicates some property which is more or less 
extreme than the property {\it X}.  In a sentence such as (\ref{ex:63}), 
some property is being said to hold of Francis such that it is of a 
kind with {\it stupid} and that it exceeds {\it stupid} on some scale 
(intelligence, for example).  Quirk et al. also note that these 
constructions remark on the inadequacy of the lexical item.  Thus, in 
(\ref{ex:62}), it could be that {\it stupid} is a starting point from which 
the speaker makes an approximation for some property which the speaker 
feels is beyond the range of the English lexicon, but which expresses 
the supreme lack of intellect of the individual it is predicated of. 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Francis is more than stupid.}\label{ex:63} 
\sitem{Romario is more than just upset.}\label{ex:64} 
\endsentences

 
Taking our inspiration from $\beta$ARBaPa, we can handle these 
comparatives, which have the same distribution but contain an empty 
adjective, by using the tree shown in Figure~\ref{ARBPa-tree}. 
 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
\centering 
\begin{tabular}{cc} 
{\htmladdimg{ps/comparatives-files/betaARBPa.ps.gif}} 
\end{tabular}\\ 
\begin{rawhtml} <dl> <dt>{Tree for Adjective-Extreme Comparative: $\beta$ARBPa <p> </dl> \end{rawhtml}
\label {ARBPa-tree} 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
 
This sort of metalinguistic comparative also occurs with the verb 
phrase, prepositional phrase, and noun varieties. 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Clark more than makes the rules. (VP)}\label{ex:65} 
\sitem{Calvin's hands are more than near the cookie jar. (PP)}\label{ex:66} 
\sitem{That stuff on her face is more than mud. (NP)}\label{ex:67} 
\endsentences

 
\noindent Presumably, the analysis for these would parallel that for 
adjectives, though it has not yet been implemented. 
 
 
\section{Propositional Comparatives} 
 
\subsection{Nominal Comparatives}\label{nom-comparatives-section} 
 
Nominal comparatives are considered here to be those which compare the 
cardinality of two sets of entities denoted by nominal phrases.  The 
following data lay out a basic distribution of these comparatives. 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{More vikings than mongols eat spam.}\label{ex:68} 
\sitem{*More the vikings than mongols eat spam.}\label{ex:69} 
\sitem{Vikings eat less spaghetti than spam.}\label{ex:70} 
\sitem{More men that walk to the store than women who despise spam enjoyed the football game.}\label{ex:71} 
\sitem{More men than James hate scotch on the rocks.}\label{ex:72} 
\sitem{James knows fewer bunnies than rabbits.}\label{ex:73} 
\endsentences

 
Looking at these examples, we are tempted to produce a tree for this 
construction that is similar to $\beta$ARBaPa.  However, it is quite 
common for the {\it than} portion of these comparatives to be left 
out, as in the following sentences: 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{More vikings eat spam.}\label{ex:74} 
\sitem{Mongols eat less spam.}\label{ex:75} 
\endsentences

 
\noindent Furthermore, {\it than NP} cannot occur without {\it more}. 
These facts indicate that we can and should build up nominal 
comparatives with two separate trees.  The first, which allows a 
comparative adverb to adjoin to a noun, is given in 
Figure~\ref{nom-compar}(a). The second is the noun-phrase modifying 
prepositional tree.  The tree $\beta$CARBn is anchored by {\it more/less/fewer} and $\beta$CnxPnx is anchored by {\it than}.  The 
feature {\bf compar} is used to ensure that only one $\beta$CARBn tree 
can adjoin to any given noun---its foot node is {\bf compar-} and the 
root node is {\bf compar+}.  All nouns are {\bf compar-}, and the {\bf compar} value is passed up through all trees which adjoin to N or NP. 
In order to ensure that we do not allow sentences like *{\it Vikings than mongols eat spam}, the {\bf compar} feature is used.  The NP foot 
node of $\beta$CnxPnx is {\bf compar+}; thus, $\beta$CnxPnx will 
adjoin only to NP's which have been already modified by $\beta$CARBn 
(and thereby comparativized).  In this way, we capture sentences like 
(\ref{ex:74}) en route to deriving sentences like (\ref{ex:68}), in a 
principled and simple manner. 
 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
\centering 
\begin{tabular}{ccc} 
{\htmladdimg{ps/comparatives-files/betaCARBn.ps.gif}}  & 
\hspace{0.6in} 
{\htmladdimg{ps/comparatives-files/betanxPnx.ps.gif}} \\ 
(a) $\beta$CARBn tree& \qquad(b) $\beta$CnxPnx tree \\ 
\end{tabular}\\ 
\begin{rawhtml} <dl> <dt>{Nominal comparative trees <p> </dl> \end{rawhtml}
\label {nom-compar} 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
 
Further evidence for this approach comes from comparative clauses 
which are missing the noun phrase which is being compared against 
something, as in the following: 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{The vikings ate more.\footnote{We ignore here the interpretation in which the comparison covers the eating event, focussing only on the one which the comparison involves the stuff being eaten.}}\label{ex:76} 
\sitem{The vikings ate more than a boar.\footnote{This sentence differs from the metalinguistic comparison {\it That stuff on her face is more than mud} in that it involves a comment on the quantity and/or type of the compared NP, whereas the other expresses that the property denoted by the compared noun is an inadequate characterization of the thing being described.}}\label{ex:77} 
\endsentences

 
\noindent Sometimes the missing noun refers to an entity or set 
available in the prior discourse, while at other times it is a 
reference to some anonymous, unspecified set.  The former is 
exemplified in a mini-discourse such as the following: \\ 
 
\noindent Calvin: ``The mongols ate spam.''\\ 
\noindent Hobbes: ``The vikings ate more.''  \\ 
 
\noindent The latter can be seen in the following example: \\ 
 
\noindent Calvin: ``The vikings ate a a boar.''\\ 
\noindent Hobbes: ``Indeed. But in fact, the vikings ate more than a boar.'' \\ 
 
Since the lone comparatives {\it more/less/fewer} have the same basic 
distribution as noun phrases, the tree in Figure~\ref{lone-compar} is 
employed to capture this fact. The root node of $\alpha$CARB is {\bf compar+}.  Not only does this accord with our intuitions about what 
the {\bf compar} feature is supposed to indicate, it also permits 
$\beta$nxPnx to adjoin, giving us strings such as {\it more than NP} 
for free. 
 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
\centering 
\begin{tabular}{cc} 
{\htmladdimg{ps/comparatives-files/alphaCARB.ps.gif}} 
\end{tabular}\\ 
\begin{rawhtml} <dl> <dt>{Tree for Lone Comparatives: $\alpha$CARB <p> </dl> \end{rawhtml}
\label {lone-compar} 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
 
Thus, by splitting nominal comparatives into multiple trees, we make 
correct predictions about their distribution with a minimal number of 
simple trees.  Furthermore, we now also get certain comparative 
coordinations for free, once we place the requirement that nouns and 
noun phrases must match for {\bf compar} if they are to be 
coordinated.  This yields strings such as the following: 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{James eats more grapes and fewer boars than avocados.}\label{ex:78} 
\sitem{Were there more or less than fifty people (at the party)?}\label{ex:79} 
\endsentences

 
\noindent The structures are given in Figure~\ref{comparconjs}. Also, 
it will block strings like {\it more men and women than children} under the (impossible) interpretation that there are more 
men than children but the comparison of the quantity of women to 
children is not performed.  Unfortunately, it will permit comparative 
clauses such as {\it more grapes and fewer than avocados} under the 
interpretation in which there are more grapes than avocados and fewer 
of some unspecified thing than avocados (see Figure~\ref{badcomparconj}).

\label{badcomparconj} 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
 
One aspect of this analysis is that it handles the elliptical 
comparatives such as the following: 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Arnold kills more bad guys than Steven.}\label{ex:80} 
\endsentences

 
\noindent In a sense, this is actually only simulating the ellipsis of 
these constructions indirectly.  However, consider the following 
sentences: 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Arnold kills more bad guys than I do.}\label{ex:81} 
\sitem{Arnold kills more bad guys than I.}\label{ex:82} 
\sitem{Arnold kills more bad guys than me.}\label{ex:83} 
\endsentences

 
\noindent The first of these has a {\it pro}-verb phrase which has a 
nominative subject.  If we totally drop the second verb phrase, we 
find that the second NP can be in either the nominative or the 
accusative case.  Prescriptive grammars disallow accusative case, but 
it actually is more common to find accusative case---use of the 
nominative in conversation tends to sound rather stiff and unnatural. 
This accords with the present analysis in which the second noun phrase 
in these comparatives is the complement of {\it than} in $\beta$nxPnx, 
and receives its case-marking from {\it than}.  This does mean that 
the grammar will not currently accept (\ref{ex:82}), and indeed such 
sentences will only be covered by an analysis which really deals with 
the ellipsis.  Yet the fact that most speakers produce (\ref{ex:83}) 
indicates that some sort of restructuring has occured that results in 
the kind of structure the present analysis offers. 
 
There is yet another distributional fact which falls out of this 
analysis.  When comparative or comparativized adjectives modify a noun 
phrase, they can stand alone or occur with a {\it than} phrase; 
furthermore, they are obligatory when a {\it than}-phrase is present. 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Hobbes is a better teacher.}\label{ex:84} 
\sitem{Hobbes is a better teacher than Bill.}\label{ex:85} 
\sitem{A more exquisite horse launched onto the racetrack.}\label{ex:86} 
\sitem{A more exquisite horse than Black Beauty launched onto the racetrack.}\label{ex:87} 
\sitem{*Hobbes is a teacher than Bill.}\label{ex:88} 
\endsentences

 
\noindent Comparative adjectives such as {\it better} 
come from the lexicon as {\bf compar+}.  By having trees such as 
$\beta$An transmit the {\bf compar} value of the A node to the root 
N node, we can signal to $\beta$CnxPnx that it may adjoin when a 
comparative adjective has adjoined.  An example of such an adjunction 
is given in Figure~\ref{better-teacher-than-Bill}. Of course, if no 
comparative element is present in the lower part of the noun phrase, 
$\beta$nxPnx will not be able to adjoin since nouns themselves are 
{\bf compar-}.  In order to capture the fact that a comparative 
element blocks further modification to N, $\beta$An must only adjoin 
to N nodes which are {\bf compar-} in their lower feature matrix.

\begin{tabular}{cc} 
{\htmladdimg{ps/comparatives-files/better_teacher_than_Bill_nf.ps.gif}} 
\end{tabular}\\ 
\begin{rawhtml} <dl> <dt>{Adjunction of $\beta$nxPnx to NP modified by comparative adjective. <p> </dl> \end{rawhtml}
\label {better-teacher-than-Bill} 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
 
In order to obtain this result for phrases like {\it more exquisite horse}, we need to provide a way for {\it more} and {\em less} to 
modify adjectives without a {\it than}-clause as we have with 
$\beta$ARBaPa.  Actually, we need this ability independently for 
comparative adjectival phrases, as discussed in the next section. 
 
\subsection{Adjectival Comparatives} 
 
With nominal comparatives, we saw that a single analysis was amenable 
to both ``pure'' comparatives and elliptical comparatives.  This is 
not possible for adjectival comparatives, as the following examples 
demonstrate: 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{The dog is less stupid.}\label{ex:89} 
\sitem{The dog is less stupid than the cat.}\label{ex:90} 
\sitem{John is as stupid.}\label{ex:91} 
\sitem{John is as stupid as Mary.}\label{ex:92} 
\sitem{The less stupid dog waited quietly for its master.}\label{ex:93} 
\sitem{*The less stupid than the cat dog waited eagerly for its master.}\label{ex:94} 
\endsentences

 
\noindent The last example shows that comparative adjectival phrases cannot 
distribute quite as freely as comparative nominals. 
 
The analysis of elliptical comparative adjectives follows closely to 
that of comparative nominals.  We build them up by first adjoining the 
comparative element to the A node, which then signals to the AP node, 
via the {\bf compar} feature, that it may allow a {\it than}-clause to 
adjoin.  The relevant trees are given in 
Figure~\ref{ellip-adj-compar}.  $\beta$CARBa is anchored by {\it more, less} and {\it as}, and $\beta$axPnx is anchored by both {\it than} 
and {\it as}. 
 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
\centering 
\begin{tabular}{ccc} 
{\htmladdimg{ps/comparatives-files/betaCARBa.ps.gif}}  & 
\hspace{0.6in} 
{\htmladdimg{ps/comparatives-files/betaaxPnx.ps.gif}} \\ 
(a) $\beta$CARBa tree& \qquad(b) $\beta$axPnx tree \\ 
\end{tabular}\\ 
\begin{rawhtml} <dl> <dt>{Elliptical adjectival comparative trees <p> </dl> \end{rawhtml}
\label {ellip-adj-compar} 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
 
The advantages of this analysis are many.  We capture the 
distribution exhibited in the examples given in (\ref{ex:89}) - (\ref{ex:94}). 
With $\beta$CARBa, comparative elements may modify adjectives wherever 
they occur.  However, {\it than} clauses for adjectives have a more 
restricted distribution which coincides nicely with the distribution 
of AP's in the XTAG grammar.  Thus, by making them adjoin to AP rather 
than A, ill-formed sentences like (\ref{ex:94}) are not allowed. 
 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
\centering 
\begin{tabular}{cc} 
{\htmladdimg{ps/comparatives-files/black_beauty.ps.gif}} 
\end{tabular}\\ 
\begin{rawhtml} <dl> <dt>{Comparativized adjective triggering $\beta$CnxPnx. <p> </dl> \end{rawhtml}
\label {black_beauty} 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
 
 
There are two further advantages to this analysis.  One is that 
$\beta$CARBa interacts with $\beta$nxPnx to produce sequences like 
{\it more exquisite horse than Black Beauty}, a result alluded to at 
the end of Section~\ref{nom-comparatives-section}.  We achieve this by 
ensuring that the comparativeness of an adjective is controlled by a 
comparative adverb which adjoins to it.  A sample derivation is given 
in Figure~\ref{black_beauty}.  The second advantage is that we get 
sentences such as (\ref{ex:95}) for free. 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Hobbes is better than Bill.}\label{ex:95} 
\endsentences

 
\noindent Since {\it better} comes from the lexicon as {\bf compar+} 
and this value is passed up to the AP node, $\beta$axPnx can adjoin as 
desired, giving us the derivation given in 
Figure~\ref{better-than-Bill}. 
 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
\centering 
\begin{tabular}{cc} 
{\htmladdimg{ps/comparatives-files/better_than_Bill_f.ps.gif}} 
\end{tabular}\\ 
\begin{rawhtml} <dl> <dt>{Adjunction of $\beta$axPnx to comparative adjective. <p> </dl> \end{rawhtml}
\label {better-than-Bill} 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
 
Notice that the root AP node of Figure~\ref{better-than-Bill} is {\bf compar-}, so we are basically saying that strings such as {\it better than Bill} are not ``comparative.''  This accords with our use of the 
{\bf compar} feature---a positive value for {\bf compar} signals that 
the clause beneath it is to {\bf be} compared against something else. 
In the case of {\it better than Bill}, the comparison has been 
fulfilled, so we do not want it to signal for further comparisons.  A 
nice result which follows is that $\beta$axPnx cannot adjoin more than 
once to any given AP spine, and we have no need for the NA constraint 
on the tree's root node.  Also, this treatment of the comparativeness 
of various strings proves important in getting the coordination of 
comparative constructions to work properly. 
 
A note needs to be made about the analysis regarding the interaction 
of the equivalence comparative construction {\it as ... as} and the 
inequivalence comparative construction {\it more/less ... than}.  In 
the grammar, {\it more, less}, and {\it as} all anchor $\beta$CARBa, and 
both {\it than} and {\it as} anchor $\beta$axPnx.  Without further 
modifications, this of course will give us sentences such as the 
following: 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{*?Hobbes is as patient than Bill.}\label{ex:96} 
\sitem{*?Hobbes is more patient as Bill.}\label{ex:97} 
\endsentences

 
\noindent Such cases are blocked with the feature {\bf equiv}:  {\it more, less, fewer} and {\it than} are {\bf equiv-} while {\it as} (in 
both adverbial and prepositional uses) is {\bf equiv+}.  The 
prepositional trees then require that their P node and the node to 
which they are adjoining match for {\bf equiv}. 
 
An interesting phenomena in which comparisons seem to be paired with 
an inappropriate {\it as/than}-clause is exhibited in (\ref{ex:98}) and 
(\ref{ex:99}). 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Hobbes is as patient or more patient than Bill.}\label{ex:98} 
\sitem{Hobbes is more patient or as patient as Bill.}\label{ex:99} 
\endsentences

 
\noindent Though prescriptive grammars disfavor these sentences, these 
are perfectly acceptable.  We can capture the fact that the {\it as/than}-clause shares the {\bf equiv} value with the latter of the 
comparison phrases by passing the {\bf equiv} value for the second 
element to the root of the coordination tree. 
 
 
\subsection{Adverbial Comparatives} 
 
The analysis of adverbial comparatives encouragingly parallels the 
analysis for nominal and elliptical adjectival comparatives---with, 
however, some interesting differences.  Some examples of adverbial 
comparatives and their distribution are given in the following: 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{Albert works more quickly.}\label{ex:100} 
\sitem{Albert works more quickly than Richard.}\label{ex:101} 
\sitem{Albert works more.}\label{ex:102} 
\sitem{*Albert more works.}\label{ex:103} 
\sitem{Albert works more than Richard.}\label{ex:104} 
\sitem{Hobbes eats his supper more quickly than Calvin.}\label{ex:105} 
\sitem{Hobbes more quickly eats his supper than Calvin.}\label{ex:106} 
\sitem{*Hobbes more quickly than Calvin eats his supper.}\label{ex:107} 
\endsentences

 
\noindent When {\it more} is used alone as an adverb, it must also 
occur after the verb phrase. Also, it appears that adverbs modified by 
{\it more} and {\it less} have the same distribution as when they are 
not modified.  However, the {\it than} portion of an adverbial 
comparative is restricted to post verb phrase positions. 
 
The first observation can be captured by having {\it more} and {\it less} select only $\beta$vxARB from the set of adverb trees. 
Comparativization of adverbs looks very similar to that of other 
categories, and we follow this trend by giving the tree in 
Figure~\ref{more-adv-mod}(a), which parallels the adjectival and 
nominal trees, for these instances.  This handles the quite free 
distribution of adverbs which have been comparativized, while the tree 
in Figure~\ref{more-adv-mod}(b), $\beta$vxPnx, allows the {\it than} 
portion of an adverbial comparative to occur only after the verb 
phrase, blocking examples such as (\ref{ex:107}). 
 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
\centering 
\begin{tabular}{ccc} 
{\htmladdimg{ps/comparatives-files/betaCARBarb.ps.gif}}  & 
\hspace{0.6in} 
{\htmladdimg{ps/comparatives-files/betavxPnx.ps.gif}} \\ 
(a) $\beta$CARBarb tree& \qquad(b) $\beta$vxPnx tree \\ 
\end{tabular}\\ 
\begin{rawhtml} <dl> <dt>{Adverbial comparative trees <p> </dl> \end{rawhtml}
\label {more-adv-mod} 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
 
The usage of the {\bf compar} feature parallels that of the adjectives 
and nominals; however, trees which adjoin to VP are {\bf compar-} on 
their root VP node.  In this way, $\beta$vxPnx anchored by {\it than} 
or {\it as} (which must adjoin to a {\bf compar+} VP) can only adjoin 
immediately above a comparative or comparativized adverb.  This avoids 
extra parses in which the comparative adverb adjoins at a VP node 
lower than the {\it than}-clause. 
 
A final note is that {\it as} may anchor $\beta$vxPnx 
non-comparatively, as in sentence (\ref{ex:108}). This means that 
there will be two parses for sentences such as (\ref{ex:109}). 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{John works as a carpenter.}\label{ex:108} 
\sitem{John works as quickly as a carpenter.}\label{ex:109} 
\endsentences

 
\noindent This appears to be a legitimate ambiguity.  One is that John 
works as quickly as a carpenter (works quickly), and the other is that 
John works quickly when he is acting as a carpenter (but maybe he is 
slow when he acting as a plumber). 
 
\section{Future Work} 
 
\begin{itemize} 
\item Interaction with determiner sequencing (e.g., {\it several more men than women} but not {\it *every more men than women}). 
 
\item Handle sentential complement comparisons (e.g., {\it Bill eats more pasta than Angus drinks beer}). 
 
\item Add partitives. 
 
\item Deal with constructions like {\it as many} and {\it as much}. 
 
\item Look at {\it so...as} construction. 
 
\end{itemize}
