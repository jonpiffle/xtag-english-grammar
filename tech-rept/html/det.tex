\chapter{Determiners and Noun Phrases} 
\label{det-comparitives} 
 
In our English XTAG grammar,\footnote{A more detailed discussion of this analysis can be found in \cite{ircs:det98}.} all nouns select the 
noun phrase (NP) tree structure shown in Figure~\ref{np-tree}.  Common 
nouns do not require determiners in order to form grammatical 
NPs. Rather than being ungrammatical, singular countable nouns without 
determiners are restricted in interpretation and can only be 
interpreted as mass nouns.  Allowing all nouns to head determinerless 
NPs correctly treats the individuation in countable NPs as a property 
of determiners. Common nouns have negative(``-'') values for 
determiner features in the lexicon in our analysis and can only 
acquire a positive(``+'') value for those features if determiners 
adjoin to them.  Other types of NPs such as pronouns and proper nouns 
have been argued by Abney \cite{Abney87} to either be determiners or 
to move to the determiner position because they exhibit 
determiner-like behavior. We can capture this insight in our system by 
giving pronouns and proper nouns positive values for determiner 
features. For example pronouns and proper nouns would be marked as 
definite, a value that NPs containing common nouns can only obtain by 
having a definite determiner adjoin. In addition to the determiner 
features, nouns also have values for features such as reflexive 
({\bf refl}), case, pronoun ({\bf pron}) and conjunction ({\bf conj}).

  A single tree structure is selected by simple determiners, an 
auxiliary tree which adjoins to NP. An example of this determiner tree 
anchored by the determiner {\it these\/} is shown in 
Figure~\ref{det-trees}. In addition to the determiner features the 
tree in Figure~\ref{det-trees} has noun features such as {\bf case} 
(see section 4.4.2), the {\bf conj} feature to control conjunction 
(see Chapter \ref{conjunction}), {\bf rel-clause$-$} (see Chapter 
\ref{rel_clauses}) and {\bf gerund$-$} (see Chapter 
\ref{gerunds-chapter}) which prevent determiners from adjoining on top 
of relative clauses and gerund NPs respectively. 
 
Complex determiners such as genitives and partitives also anchor tree 
structures that adjoin to NP. They differ from the simple determiners 
in their internal complexity. Details of our treatment of these more 
complex constructions appear in Sections \ref{genitives} and 
\ref{partitives}.  Sequences of determiners, as in the NPs {\it all her dogs\/} or {\it those five dogs\/} are derived by multiple 
adjunctions of the determiner tree, with each tree anchored by one of 
the determiners in the sequence. The order in which the determiner 
trees can adjoin is controlled by features.

This treatment of determiners as adjoining onto NPs is similar to that 
of \cite{Abeille90:TAG}, and allows us to capture one of the insights of the DP 
hypothesis, namely that determiners select NPs as complements. In 
Figure~\ref{det-trees} the determiner and its NP complement appear in 
the configuration that is typically used in LTAG to represent 
selectional relationships. That is, the head serves as the anchor of 
the tree and it's complement is a sister node in the same elementary tree. 
 
 
The XTAG treatment of determiners uses nine features for representing 
their properties: definiteness ({\bf definite}), quantity 
({\bf quan}), cardinality ({\bf card}), genitive ({\bf gen}), 
decreasing ({\bf decreas}), constancy ({\bf const}), {\bf wh}, agreement ({\bf agr}), and complement ({\bf compl}). Seven of these 
features were developed by semanticists for their accounts of semantic 
phenomena (\cite{KeenanStavi86:LP}, \cite{BarwiseCooper81:LP}, 
\cite{Partee90:BK}), another was developed for a semantic 
account of determiner negation by one of the authors of this 
determiner analysis (\cite{Mateyak97}), and the last is the familiar 
agreement feature. When used together these features also account for 
a substantial portion of the complex patterns of English determiner 
sequencing. Although we do not claim to have exhaustively covered the 
sequencing of determiners in English, we do cover a large subset, both 
in terms of the phenomena handled and in terms of corpus coverage. The 
XTAG grammar has also been extended to include complex determiner 
constructions such as genitives and partitives using these determiner 
features. 
 
Each determiner carries with it a set of values for these features 
that represents its own properties, and a set of values for the 
properties of NPs to which can adjoin. The features are crucial to 
ordering determiners correctly. The semantic definitions 
underlying the features are given below. 
 
\begin{description} 
 
\item[Definiteness:] Possible Values [+/--]. \\ 
A function f is definite iff f is non-trivial and whenever 
f(s)~$\neq~\emptyset$ then it is always the intersection of one or 
more individuals.  \cite{KeenanStavi86:LP} 
 
\item[Quantity:]  Possible Values [+/--]. \\ 
If A and B are sets denoting an NP and associated predicate, respectively; E is 
a domain in a model M, and F is a bijection from M$_{1}$ to M$_{2}$, then we 
say that a determiner satisfies the constraint of quantity if 
Det$_{E_{1}}$AB~$\leftrightarrow$~Det$_{E_{2}}$F(A)F(B). \cite{Partee90:BK} 
 
\item[Cardinality:]  Possible Values [+/--]. \\ 
A determiner D is cardinal iff D $\in$ cardinal numbers~$\geq$~1. 
 
\item[Genitive:]  Possible Values [+/--]. \\ 
Possessive pronouns and the possessive morpheme ({\it 's}) are marked {\bf gen$+$}; all other nouns are {\bf gen$-$}. 
 
\item[Decreasing:]  Possible Values [+/--]. \\ 
A set of Q properties is decreasing iff whenever s$\leq$t and t$\in$Q then 
s$\in$Q. A function f is decreasing iff for all properties f(s) is a decreasing 
set. 
 
A non-trivial NP (one with a Det) is decreasing iff its denotation in any model 
is decreasing. \cite{KeenanStavi86:LP} 
 
\item[Constancy:] Possible Values [+/--]. \\ 
If A and B are sets denoting an NP and associated predicate, respectively, and 
E is a domain, then we say that a determiner displays constancy if 
(A$\cup$B)~$\subseteq$~E~$\subseteq$~E$^{\prime}$ then 
Det$_{E}$AB~$\leftrightarrow$~Det$_{E^{\prime}}$AB. Modified from 
\cite{Partee90:BK} 
 
\item[Complement:] Possible Values [+/--]. \\ 
A determiner Q is positive complement if and only if for every set X, there 
exists a continuous set of possible values for the size of the negated 
determined set, NOT(QX), and the cardinality of QX is the only aspect of QX 
that can be negated. (adapted from \cite{Mateyak97}) 
 
\end{description} 
 
The {\bf wh}-feature has been discussed in the linguistics literature mainly in relation to wh-movement and with respect to NPs and nouns as well as determiners. We give a shallow but useful working definition of the {\bf wh}-feature below: 
 
\begin{description} 
 
\item[Wh:]  Possible Values [+/--]. \\ 
Interrogative determiners are {\bf wh$+$}; all other determiners are 
{\bf wh$-$}. 
\end{description} 
 
The {\bf agr} feature is inherently a noun feature.  While determiners 
are not morphologically marked for agreement in English many of them 
are sensitive to number.  Many determiners are semantically either 
singular or plural and must adjoin to nouns which are the same. For 
example, {\it a\/} can only adjoin to singular nouns ({\it a dog\/} vs 
{\it $\ast$a dogs\/} while {\it many\/} must have plurals ({\it many dogs\/} vs {\it $\ast$many dog\/}). Other determiners such as {\it some} are 
unspecified for agreement in our analysis because they are compatible 
with either singulars or plurals ({\it some dog}, {\it some dogs}). The possible values of agreement for determiners are: [3sg, 3pl, 3]. 
 
 
 
 
The determiner tree in Figure~\ref{det-trees} shows the appropriate 
feature values for the determiner {\it these}, while Table \ref{det-values} 
shows the corresponding feature values of several other common determiners.

In addition to the features that represent their own properties, determiners 
also have features to represent the selectional

selectional restriction features of a determiner appear on the NP footnode of 
the auxiliary tree that the determiner anchors.  The NP$_{f}$ node in Figure~\ref{det-trees} shows the selectional feature 
restriction imposed by {\it these}\footnote{In addition to this tree, {\it these} would also anchor another auxiliary tree that adjoins onto {\bf card+} determiners.}, while Table~\ref{det-ordering} shows the corresponding 
selectional feature restrictions of several other determiners.

\section{The Wh-Feature} 
\label{agr-section} 
A determiner with a {\bf wh+} feature is always the left-most 
determiner in linear order since no determiners have selectional 
restrictions that allow them to adjoin onto an NP with a +wh feature 
value.  The presence of a wh+ determiner makes the entire NP wh+, and 
this is correctly represented by the coindexation of the determiner 
and root NP nodes' values for the wh-feature. Wh+ determiners' 
selectional restrictions on the NP foot node of their tree only allows them 
adjoin onto NPs that are {\bf wh-} or unspecified for the 
wh-feature. Therefore ungrammatical sequences such as {\it $\ast$which what dog} are impossible.  The adjunction of {\bf wh +} determiners onto 
{\bf wh+} pronouns is also prevented by the same mechanism. 
 
\section{Multi-word Determiners} 
The system recognizes the multi-word determiners {\it a few} and {\it many a}. 
The features for a multi-word determiner are located on the parent node of its 
two components (see Figure~\ref{multi-det-tree}).  We chose to represent these 
determiners as multi-word constituents because neither determiner retains the 
same set of features as either of its parts.  For example, the determiner 
{\it a} is 3sg and {\it few} is decreasing, while {\it a few} is 3pl and 
increasing.  Additionally, {\it many} is 3pl and {\it a} displays constancy, 
but {\it many a} is 3sg and does not display constancy.  Example sentences 
appear in (\ref{ex:128})-(\ref{ex:129}). 
 
\begin{itemize} 
\item{Multi-word Determiners} 
\beginsentences
\sitem{{\bf a few} teaspoons of sugar should be adequate .}\label{ex:128} 
\sitem{{\bf many a} man has attempted that stunt, but none have succeeded .}\label{ex:129}

\section{Genitive Constructions} 
\label{genitives}        
 
There are two kinds of genitive constructions: genitive pronouns, and genitive 
NP's (which have an explicit genitive marker, {\it 's}, associated with them). 
It is clear from examples such as {\it her dog returned home\/} and 
{\it her five dogs returned home} vs {\it $\ast$dog returned home\/} that genitive pronouns function as determiners and as 
such, they sequence with the rest of the determiners.  The features for the 
genitives are the same as for other determiners.  Genitives are not required to agree with 
either the determiners or the nouns in the NPs that they modify. The 
value of the {\bf agr} feature for an NP with a genitive determiner 
depends on the NP to which the genitive determiner adjoins. While it 
might seem to make sense to take {\it their} as 3pl, {\it my} as 1sg, 
and {\it Alfonso's} as 3sg, this number and person information only 
effects the genitive NP itself and bears no relationship to the number 
and person of the NPs with these items as determiners. Consequently, 
we have represented {\bf agr} as unspecified for genitives in Table 
\ref{det-values}. 
 
Genitive NP's are particularly interesting because they are potentially 
recursive structures.  Complex NP's can easily be embedded within a determiner. 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{[[[John]'s friend from high school]'s uncle]'s mother came to town.}\label{ex:130} 
\endsentences

 
There are two things to note in the above example.  One is that in embedded 
NPs, the genitive morpheme comes at the end of the NP phrase, even if the head 
of the NP is at the beginning of the phrase.  The other is that the determiner 
of an embedded NP can also be a genitive NP, hence the possibility of recursive 
structures. 
 
In the XTAG grammar, the genitive marker, {\it 's}, is separated from the 
lexical item that it is attached to and given its own category (G).  In 
this way, we can allow the full complexity of NP's to come from the 
existing NP system, including any recursive structures.  As with the simple 
determiners, there is one auxiliary tree structure for genitives which 
adjoins to NPs. As can be seen in \ref{gen-trees}, this tree is anchored by 
the genitive marker {\it 's} and has a branching D node which accomodates 
the additional internal structure of genitive determiners. Also, like simple 
determiners, there is one initial tree structure 
(Figure~\ref{subst-genNP-tree}) available for substitution where needed, as 
in, for example, the Determiner Gerund NP tree (see 
Chapter~\ref{gerunds-chapter} for discussion on determiners for gerund 
NP's).

\label{subst-genNP-tree} 
\begin{rawhtml} <p> \end{rawhtml}
 
Since the NP node which is sister 
to the G node could also have a genitive determiner in it, the type of 
genitive recursion shown in (\ref{ex:130}) is quite naturally accounted for 
by the genitive tree structure used in our analysis. 
 
\section{Partitive Constructions}        
\label{partitives}                        
 
The deciding factor for including an analysis of partitive constructions(e.g.\ {\it some kind of}, {\it all of\/}) as a complex determiner constructions was the 
behavior of the agreement features.  If partitive constructions are analyzed as 
an NP with an adjoined PP, then we would expect to get agreement with the head 
of the NP (as in ({\ref{ex:131}})).  If, on the other hand, we analyze them 
as a determiner construction, then we would expect to get agreement with the 
noun that the determiner sequence modifies (as we do in ({\ref{ex:132}})). 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{a {\it kind} [of these machines] {\it is} prone to failure.}\label{ex:131} 
\sitem{[a kind of] these {\it machines are} prone to failure.}\label{ex:132} 
\endsentences

 
In other words, for partitive constructions, the semantic head of the NP is the second rather than the first noun in linear order. That the agreement shown in ({\ref{ex:132}}) is possible suggests that the second noun in linear order in these constructions should also be treated as the syntactic head. Note that both the partitive and PP readings are usually possible for a particular NP. In the cases where either the partitive or the PP reading is preferred, we take it to be just that, a preference, most appropriately modeled not in the grammar but in a component such as the heuristics used with the XTAG parser for reducing the analyses produced to the most likely. 
 
In our analysis the partitive tree in Figure~\ref{part-tree} is anchored 
by one of a limited group of nouns that can appear in the determiner 
portion of a partitive construction. A rough semantic characterization 
of these nouns is that they either represent quantity (e.g. {\it part, half, most, pot, cup, pound} etc.) or classification (e.g. {\it type, variety, kind, version} etc.).  In the absence of a more implementable 
characterization we use a list of such nouns compiled from a 
descriptive grammar \cite{quirk85}, a thesaurus, and from online 
corpora. In our grammar the nouns on the list are the only ones that 
select the partitive determiner tree.

Like other determiners, partitives can adjoin to an NP consisting of just 
a noun ({\it `[a certain kind of] machine'}), or adjoin to NPs 
that already have determiners ({\it `[some parts of] these machines'}. Notice that just as for the genitives, the complexity and 
the recursion are contained below the D node and rest of the structure 
is the same as for simple determiners. 
 
\section{Adverbs, Noun Phrases, and Determiners} 
\label{adverbial-section}

Many adverbs interact with the noun phrase and determiner system in English. 
For example, consider sentences (\ref{approx})-(\ref{double}) below. 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{\label{approx}{\bf Approximately} thirty people came to the lecture.} 
\sitem{\label{practically}{\bf Practically} every person in the theater was laughing hysterically during that scene.} 
\sitem{\label{only}{\bf Only} John's crazy mother can make stuffing that tastes so good.} 
\sitem{\label{relatively}{\bf Relatively} few programmers remember how to program in COBOL.} 
\sitem{\label{not}{\bf Not} every martian would postulate that all humans speak a universal language.} 
\sitem{\label{enough}{\bf Enough} money was gathered to pay off the group gift.} 
\sitem{\label{quite}{\bf Quite} a few burglaries occurred in that neighborhood last year.} 
\sitem{\label{double}I wanted to be paid {\bf double} the amount they offered.} 
\endsentences

 
Although there is some debate in the literature as to whether these should be 
classified as determiners or adverbs, we believe that these items that 
interact with the NP and determiner system are in fact adverbs.   These items 
exhibit a broader distribution than either determiners or adjectives in that 
they can modify many other phrasal categories, including adjectives, verb 
phrases, prepositional phrases, and other adverbs. 
 
Using the determiner feature system, we can obtain a close approximation to an 
accurate characterization of the behavior of the adverbs that interact with 
noun phrases and determiners.  Adverbs can adjoin to either a determiner or a 
noun phrase (see figure~\ref{det-adv-trees}), with the adverbs restricting what 
types of NPs or determiners they can modify by imposing feature requirements on 
the foot D or NP node.  For 
example, the adverb {\it approximately}, seen in (\ref{approx}) 
above, selects for determiners that are {\bf card+}.  The adverb {\it enough} 
in (\ref{enough}) is an example of an adverb that selects for a noun phrase, 
specifically a noun phrase that is not modified by a determiner.

Most of the adverbs that modify determiners and NPs divide into six classes, 
with some minor variation within classes, based on the pattern of these 
restrictions.  Three of the classes are adverbs that modify determiners, while 
the other three modify NPs. 
 
The largest of the five classes is the class of adverbs that modify cardinal 
determiners.  This class includes, among others, the adverbs {\it about}, {\it at most}, {\it exactly}, {\it nearly}, and {\it only}.  These adverbs have the 
single restriction that they must adjoin to determiners that are {\bf card+}. 
Another class of adverbs consists of those that can modify the determiners {\it every}, {\it all}, {\it any}, and {\it no}.  The adverbs in this class are {\it almost}, {\it nearly}, and {\it practically}.  Closely related to this class 
are the adverbs {\it mostly} and {\it roughly}, which are restricted to 
modifying {\it every} and {\it all}, and {\it hardly}, which can only modify 
{\it any}.  To select for {\it every}, {\it all}, and {\it any}, these adverbs 
select for determiners that are [{\bf quan+}, {\bf card-}, {\bf const+}, {\bf compl+}], and to select for {\it no}, the adverbs choose a determiner that is 
[{\bf quan+}, {\bf decreas+}, {\bf const+}].  The third class of adverbs that 
modify determiners are those that modify the determiners {\it few} and {\it many}, representable by the feature sequences [{\bf quan+}, {\bf decreas+}, 
{\bf const-}] and [{\bf quan+}, {\bf decreas-}, {\bf const-}, {\bf 3pl}, {\bf compl+}], respectively.  Examples of these adverbs are {\it awfully}, {\it fairly}, {\it relatively}, and {\it very}. 
 
Of the three classes of adverbs that modify noun phrases, one actually consists 
of a single adverb {\it not}, that only modifies determiners that are {\bf compl+}.  Another class consists of the focus adverbs, {\it at least}, {\it even}, {\it only}, and {\it just}.  These adverbs select NPs that are {\bf wh-} 
and {\bf card-}.  For the NPs that are {\bf card+}, the focus adverbs actually 
modify the cardinal determiner, and so these adverbs are also included in the 
first class of adverbs mentioned in the previous paragraph.  The last major 
class that modify NPs consist of the adverbs {\it double} and {\it twice}, 
which select NPs that are [{\bf definite+}] (i.e., {\it the}, {\it this/that/those/these}, and the genitives). 
 
Although these restrictions succeed in recognizing the correct 
determiner/adverb sequences, a few unacceptable sequences slip through.  For 
example, in handling the second class of adverbs mentioned above, {\it every}, 
{\it all}, and {\it any} share the features [{\bf quan+}, {\bf card-}, {\bf const+}, {\bf compl+}] with {\it a} and {\it another}, and so {\it $\ast$nearly a man} is acceptable in this system.  In addition to this 
over-generation within a major class, the adverb {\it quite} selects for 
determiners and NPs in what seems to be a purely idiosyncratic fashion. 
Consider the following examples. 
 
\beginsentences
\sitem{\label{quite2}\item[a.] {\bf Quite} a few members of the audience had to leave. 	\item[b.] There were {\bf quite} many new participants at this year's conference. 	\item[c.] {\bf Quite} few triple jumpers have jumped that far. 	\item[d.] Taking the day off was {\bf quite} the right thing to do. 	\item[e.] The recent negotiation fiasco is {\bf quite} another issue. 	\item[f.] Pandora is {\bf quite} a cat!} 
\endsentences

 
In examples (\ref{quite2}a)-(\ref{quite2}c), {\it quite} modifies the determiner, while in (\ref{quite2}d)-(\ref{quite2}f), 
{\it quite} modifies the entire noun phrase.  Clearly, it functions in a 
different manner in the two sets of sentences; in (\ref{quite2}a)-(\ref{quite2}c), {\it quite} 
intensifies the amount implied by the determiner, whereas in (\ref{quite2}d)-(\ref{quite2}f), it 
singles out an individual from the larger set to which it belongs.  To capture 
the selectional restrictions needed for (\ref{quite2}a)-(\ref{quite2}c), we utilize the two sets of 
features mentioned previously for selecting {\it few} and {\it many}.  However, 
{\it a few} cannot be singled out so easily; using the sequence [{\bf quan+}, 
{\bf card-}, {\bf decreas-}, {\bf const+}, {\bf 3pl}, {\bf compl-}], we also 
accept the ungrammatical NPs {\it $\ast$quite several members} and {\it $\ast$quite some members} (where {\it quite} modifies {\it some}).  In 
selecting {\it the} as in (d) with the features [{\bf definite+}, {\bf gen-}, {\bf 3sg}], {\it quite} also selects {\it this} and {\it that}, which are 
ungrammatical in this position.  Examples (\ref{quite2}e) and (\ref{quite2}f) present yet another 
obstacle in that in selecting {\it another} and {\it a}, {\it quite} 
erroneously selects {\it every} and {\it any}. 
 
It may be that there is an undiscovered semantic feature that would 
alleviate these difficulties.  However, on the whole, the determiner feature system we have proposed can be 
used as a surprisingly efficient method of characterizing the interaction of 
adverbs with determiners and noun phrases.
