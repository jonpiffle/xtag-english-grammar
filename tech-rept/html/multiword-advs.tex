The grammar also includes auxiliary trees anchored by multi-word adverbs 
like {\it a little}, {\it a bit}, {\it a mite}, {\it sort of}, {\it kind of}, etc.. 
 
Multi-word adverbs like {\it sort of} and {\it kind of} can pre- modify 
almost any non-clausal category. The only strict constraint on their 
occurrence is that they can't modify nouns (in which case an adjectival 
interpretation would obtain)\footnote{Note that there are semantic/lexical constraints even for the categories that these adverbs {\it can} modify, and no doubt invite a more in-depth analysis.}. The category which they 
scope over can be directly determined from their position, except for when 
they occur sentence finally in which case they are assumed to modify 
VP's. The complete list of auxiliary trees anchored by these adverbs are as 
follows: $\beta$NPax, $\beta$NPpx, $\beta$NPnx, $\beta$NPvx, $\beta$vxNP, 
$\beta$NParb. Selected trees are shown in Figure~\ref{sortof-adv-tree}, and 
some examples are given in (\ref{ex:371})-(\ref{ex:374}).

There are some multi-word adverbs that are, however, not so free in their 
distribution. Adverbs like {\it a little}, {\it a bit}, {\it a mite} modify 
AP's in predicative constructions (sentences with the copula and small 
clauses, AP complements in sentences with raising verbs, and AP's when they 
are subcategorized for by certain verbs (e.g., {\it John felt angry}). They 
can also post-modify VP's and PP's, though not as freely as 
AP's\footnote{They can also appear before NP's, as in, ``John wants {\it a little} sugar''. However, here they function as multi-word determiners and should not be analyzed as adverbs.}. Finally, they also function as 
downtoners for almost all adverbials\footnote{It is to be noted that this analysis, which allows these multiword adverbs to modify adjectival phrases as well as adverbials, will yield (not necessarily desirable) multiple derivations for a sentence like {\it John is a little unecessarily stupid}. In one derivation, {\it a little} modifies the AP and in the other case, it modifies the adverb.}. Some examples are provided in 
(\ref{ex:375})-(\ref{ex:378}).

Following their behavior as described above, the auxiliary trees they 
anchor are $\beta$DAax, $\beta$DApx, $\beta$vxDA, $\beta$DAarb, 
$\beta$DNax, $\beta$DNpx, $\beta$vxDN, $\beta$DNarb. Selected trees are 
shown in Figure~\ref{alittle-adv-tree}).
