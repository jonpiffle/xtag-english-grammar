This document describes a sizable grammar of English written in the TAG 
formalism and implemented for use with the XTAG system. This report and the 
grammar described herein supersedes the TAG grammar described in 
\cite{tech-rept98}. The English grammar described in this report is based 
on the TAG formalism developed in \cite{joshi75}, which has been extended 
to include lexicalization (\cite{schabes88}), and unification-based feature 
structures (\cite{vijay91}).  The range of syntactic phenomena that can be 
handled is large and includes auxiliaries (including inversion), copula, 
raising and small clause constructions, topicalization, relative clauses, 
infinitives, gerunds, passives, adjuncts, ditransitives (and datives), 
ergatives, it-clefts, wh-clefts, PRO constructions, noun-noun 
modifications, extraposition, determiner sequences, genitives, negation, 
noun-verb contractions, sentential adjuncts, imperatives and resultatives. 
The XTAG grammar is continuously updated with the addition of new analyses 
and modification of old ones, and an online version of this report can be 
found at the XTAG web page: {\tt http://www.cis.upenn.edu/\~{}xtag/}.
