This document describes a sizable grammar of English written in the
TAG formalism and implemented for use with the XTAG system. This
report and the grammar described herein supersedes the TAG grammar
described in the earlier 1995 XTAG technical report. The English
grammar described in this report is based on the TAG formalism
developed in [Joshi et al, 1975], which has been extended to include
lexicalization ([Schabes et al, 1988]), and unification-based feature
structures ([Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1991]).  The range of syntactic
phenomena that can be handled is large and includes auxiliaries
(including inversion), copula, raising and small clause constructions,
topicalization, relative clauses, infinitives, gerunds, passives,
adjuncts, it-clefts, wh-clefts, PRO constructions, noun-noun
modifications, extraposition, determiner sequences, genitives,
negation, noun-verb contractions, sentential adjuncts and imperatives.
This technical report corresponds to the XTAG Release 8/31/98. The
XTAG grammar is continuously updated with the addition of new analyses
and modification of old ones, and an online version of this report can
be found at the XTAG web page: http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~xtag/.
