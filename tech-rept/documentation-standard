This is a simple documentation standard FOR THE ANALYSIS AND
IMPELEMENTATION OF VARIOUS LINGUISTIC PHENOMENA that tech-report writers
must follow. Other chapters of the report are obviously not subject to
these rules:


*** section 1: introduction of the phenomena itself, however simple it may
    seem to you. This will also involve presentation of the data.

*** section 2: if a survey of the linguistic literature has been done with
    respect to what kind of structure/analysis the relevant construction
    should get, then do the survey (not necessarily detailed and full of
    jargon - you should skim through other chapters at this point to see as
    to what extent and depth surveys of lietrature are given), otherwise,
    skip to section 3.

*** section 3: describe the implementation. Be sure to give a precise
    description of all the important details and the interactions that are
    relevant to the coverage of the phenomenon.

*** section 4: Cases not handled (if any)


You can add subsections within each of the sections if necessary.
