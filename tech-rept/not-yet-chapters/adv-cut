\begin{itemize}
\begin {enumerate}
   \item Roughly speaking, adverbs can be in sentence-intial, medial and
final positions.  How do we account for the order-variation of adverbs? 
     \begin{verse}
      (Now) he is (now) living in N.Y. (now).\\
      (Bravely), Frank (bravely) had (bravely) fought in Spain (bravely).\\
      (Here), you can (here) see the symptom (here).
     \end{verse}
   \item Do we need a trace for wh-adverbs (eg. where, when, why, how)?
     \begin{verse}
      Where/when/how/why did you see the Unicorn?
     \end{verse}
  \end{enumerate}
 \item Implementational Issues 
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item What are the tree sets for adverbs?
   \item TAG treatment of Wh-adverbs
   \item Adverb lexicon
  \end{enumerate}
 \item General Question: What are the criteria deciding
the subclasses of adverbs? For instance, what are S-adverbs, what are
VP-adverbs, and what are both, and is there any way of dividing
automatically? 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Order Variation of Adverbs}

\subsubsection{Kinds of Adverbs: [Quirk et al]}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Time-adverbials ({\em when})
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item Time-when adverbials denote a point or period of time, and/or
imply the point from which that time is measured.
     \begin{verse}
      Do come and see again.\\
      The meeting starts tomorrow \\
      I'm just finishing my homework.({\em just\/} always in mid-position)\\
      (Then) he (then) has (then) lived in N.Y.(then).\\
      (Recently) they (recently) had an accident (recently)
     \end{verse}
   \item Time duration adverbials denote (1) length of time or (2) duration
         from some preceding point of time. 
     \begin{verse}
      They always/temorarily out of work.
     \end{verse}
   \item Time frequency adverbials denote either (1) definite
         frequency, or (2) indefinte frequency. They can occur any of
         the three positions. eg. {\em weekly, generally, normally,
         always, regulary, sometimes, rarely, etc.}
  \end{enumerate}
 \item Place adverbials ({\em where\/})
     \begin{verse}
      (Outside), the boys were jumping and skipping (outside).\\
      (In the nursery) the children were playing happily but noisily.\\
      The children were playing happily but noisily (in the nursery).
     \end{verse}
 \item Manner adverbs ({\em how\/}) are assumed to modify VP's.
     \begin{verse}
      They live frugally.\\
      They examined the specimen microscopically.\\
      He put the point well/*He well put the point \\
      The point was put well/The point was well-put.
     \end{verse}     
 \item Sentence adverbs are periphral to the sentence structure, and have
       a wide range of possible structures:  
     \begin{verse}
      Frankly, he hasn't got a chance.\\
      in all frankness \\
      to be frank/to speak fankly/to put it frankly \\
      frankly speaking/putting it frankly \\
      put frankly \\
      if I may be frank/if I can speak frankly/if I can put it frankly
     \end{verse}
       More sentence adverbs are
       {\em admittedly, certainly, definitely, indeed, surely, perhaps,
          possibly; in fact, actually, really; officially,
          superficially, technically, theoretically; fortunately,
          hopefully, luckily, naturally, preferably, strangely,
          surprisingly, etc.}
          Many other sentence adverbials (eg. however, therefore,
          moreover) have a connective role.
Many adverbs can function as both manner and sentence adverbs,
depending on the position of the adverb. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{How do We Explain the Order Variation of Adverbs?}

\subsubsection{Transformational Approach}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Emonds(76): assumes all adverbs are derived from adjectives,
the problems of which I do not discuss here.
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item For manner adverbs, he assumes the end position to be the
base position and derive other positions by a transformation.
     \begin{verse}
      Sam would toot his trumpet {\em loudly\/} \\
      $\rightarrow$ Transformation \\
      Sam would {\em loudly\/} toot his trumpet.
     \end{verse}
   \item He motivates a second base position immediately
preceding the main verb to account for the following contrast:
     \begin{verse}
      Harold {\em merely/scarecely\/} finished his breakfast.\\
      *Harold finished his breakfast {\em merely/scarecely\/}.\\
      VP $\rightarrow$ (AP) - V - ...
     \end{verse}
   \item There is a third base position accounting for the case of
{\em merely\/}, {\em scarecely\/}, etc. before various auxiliaries.
     \begin{verse}
      Rover {\em merely\/} would have been put outside.\\
      Rover would {\em merely\/} have been put outside.\\
      Rover would have {\em merely\/} been put outside.\\
      Rover would have been {\em merely\/} put outside.\\
      S $\rightarrow$ COMP - NP - (AP) - M - ...
     \end{verse}
   \item Two transformations for factives: {\bf adverb dislocation}
moves them to sentence-final position and another root transformation
moves them to sentence-initial position.
     \begin{verse}
      Joe {\em certainly\/} made a mess of this.\\
      {\em Certainly\/}, Joe made a mess of this.\\
      Joe made a mess of this, {\em certainly\/}.
     \end{verse}
    \end{enumerate}
In summary, Emonds(76) has two base rules and a postverbal base
position (ie. three base positions). Transformation will move adverbs
right before the verb, and will move factives to the end or the
beginning of the sentence. Interpretation is affected before these
transformations, ie. at deep structure.
 \item Jackendoff(72)
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item His analysis begins with a preliminary set-up of six
subclasses of adverbs, according to their pattern of occurrence, and
meaning in sentence intial position, in the AuxRange, and in sentence
final position. 
     \begin{itemize}
      \item All three positions, with change of meaning:
agent-oriented {\em cleverly\/}, discourse-oriented {\em frankly\/},
evaluative {\em happily\/}
      \item All three positions with the same meaning: frequency {\em
often\/}, time {\em soon\/}, aspect-manner {\em slowly\/},
mental-attitude {\em reluctantly\/}
      \item All three positions with obligatory pause in final
position: epistemic {\em evidently\/}, evaluative {\em fortunately\/}
      \item Auxiliary and final position only: degree {\em
completely\/}, manner {\em mortally\/}, mental-attitude {\em purposefully\/}
      \item Final position only (mostly non-{\em ly\/} adverbs): degree {\em
more\/}, time {\em early\/}, place {\em downstairs\/}, aspect-manner
{\em slow\/}
      \item Auxiliary position only: SD {\em merely\/}, intensifiers
{\em simply\/}, B-adverbs {\em scarecely\/}, degree {\em utterly\/}
     \end{itemize}
     \begin{verse}
      ({\em Cleverly\/}), he ({\em cleverly\/}) answered the questions ({\em cleverly\/}).\\
      ({\em Often\/}), she ({\em often\/}) comes late ({\em often\/}).\\
      ({\em Evidently\/}), Casey ({\em evidently\/}) thinks that there are left-wing\\
       guerrillas camped inthe rose garden ({\em evidently\/}).\\ 
      (*{\em Completely\/}), the Senator from North Carolina ({\em completely\/}) alienated
        his colleagues ({\em completely\/}).\\
      (*{\em Early\/}), he (*{\em early\/}) arrived ({\em early\/}).\\
      (*{\em Merely\/}), Feckenstein ({\em merely\/}) falsified a few papers here\\
        and there ({\em merely\/}). 
     \end{verse}
   \item Syntax for Adverbs
     \begin{itemize}
      \item Base-positions generated by the following PS rules:
       \begin{verse}
        PP $\rightarrow$ P - (NP) \\
        VP $\rightarrow$ (have-en)(be-ing)(Adv) - V - (NP) - (Adv/PP)$^{*}$\\
        S $\rightarrow$ NP - Aux - VP - (Adv/PP/S)$^{*}$
       \end{verse}
      \item Transformation to move Degree Adverbs from the first adverb node
            in the second base rule to a position before Aux;
     \end{itemize}
    To account for sentence-initial and auxiliary position he invokes
    Keyser's (1968) `Transportability' convention. Keyser suggested
    that adverbs could be marked [+transportable], and then, by the convention,
    moved anywhere as long as they preserved sister relationships.
    That is, an adverb dominated by S could move to any other position dominated
    by S, and if dominated by VP could move to any position if still
    dominated by VP -- Another way of expressing Transformation.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

We need a number of different transformations (primarily) depending on the
semantics of the adverbs. That is, we have to resort to semantics to
formulate the right kind of transformation.  Task to be performed is
to find out a systematic way of categorizing the adverbs which undergo
the same kind of transformation.


\subsection{Adverb Trace}

\subsubsection{Syntactic Consideration: cf. Lasnik\&Saito 84}
 
The motivation of having gaps in a transformational analysis of
extraction construction like wh-question, topicalization, etc. is
based on the consideration that these constructions behave
as though there is a node of the appropriate type in the position of
the extraction site (cf. Jacobson 82). The following are some
empirical evidence supporting this consideration:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Subcategorization of P and V: Transitive verbs and prepositions 
cannot, in general, occur without a following NP, but they can occur in 
these constructions.
  \begin{verse}
   Which do you think your father put in the garage?\\
   $*$My father put in the garage.\\
   Who did you talk with?\\
   $*$I talked with.
  \end{verse}
 \item In some dialect nominal wh-phrases make a clear case-marking
distinction with regard to the position of the extraction site.
  \begin{verse}
   *Who/Whom did John see?\\
   Who/*Whom did John say was coming.
  \end{verse}
 \item person/number agreement:
  \begin{verse}
     {\em Which boy\/} might he say {\em likes\/} Mary?\\
     $*${\em Which boy\/} might he say {\em like\/} Mary?\\
     {\em Which boys\/} might he say {\em like\/} Mary?\\
     $*${\em Which boys\/} might he say {\em likes\/} Mary?
  \end{verse}
 \item {\em wanna\/} contraction:
  \begin{verse}
   I wanna go to a movie.\\
   Who do you wanna go to the movie with?\\
   $*$Who do you wanna go to the movie with Chris?
  \end{verse}
\end{itemize}

If we follow the line of reasoning above in positing a trace for
wh-phrases, there is no reason to posit a trace for adverbial
wh-phrases: Adverbials are not subcategorized for by verbs or
prepositions. There is no overt morphological evidence to identify the
position of the extraction site of adverbs. 


 


\subsection{TAG Treatment of Adverbs}

\subsubsection{Tree Sets for Adverbs}

Besides the adverbs discussed in 2.1, which can be categorized as
VP-/S-modifying adverbs, there are adverbs of other category as listed
below:\footnote{This categorization is taken from {\em A Communicative
Grammar of English\/} [Leech and Svartvik 75].}

\begin{itemize}
 \item modify an adjective: {\em exteremely\/} good, {\em rather\/} tall,
       rich {\em enough\/} 
 \item modify an adverb: oddly {\em enough\/}, {\em very\/} well
 \item modify a PP: {\em right\/} through the wall
 \item modify a determiner, pronoun, numeral: He has {\em hardly\/} any 
       friends, {\em over\/} two hundred deaths 
 \item modify an NP: {\em rather/quite\/} a mess, {\em such\/} a funny story
 \item modify a noun: his journey {\em home\/}, the {\em above\/} statement, 
       the sentence {\em below\/}
\end{itemize}  

We have separate trees for each of the categories, except for the
fourth item, for which we consider the adverbs to modify an NP rather
than a determiner, pronoun, or numerals.  The trees are auxiliary
trees $\beta$adX, $\beta$Xad, where X is a variable over S, VP, NP, A,
Ad, PP, and an initial tree $\alpha$Ad.

\subsubsection{Order Variation of Adverbs}

\subsubsection{General Remark In the Frame of Subj - Main Verb - Obj}

Order variation of an adverb is represented by different trees. For
instance, if an adverb can occur in sentence initial, preverbal and
sentence final positions as shown in (8) and (9), it can represented by
four different trees $\beta$adS, $\beta$adVP, $\beta$VPad, and
$\beta$Sad.

\begin{verse}
(8) ({\em Cleverly\/}) he ({\em cleverly\/}) answered the questions
({\em cleverly\/}).\\
(9) My car does not start on the first trial everyday.
\end{verse}

We assign two trees $\beta$VPad and $\beta$Sad to sentence final
adverbs since it can be interpreted as modifying the VP or the whole
S: e.g. (8) with the adverb {\em cleverly\/} in sentence final
position has two interpretations (a) It was clever that he answered
the question (S-modifying), (b) He answered question in a clever
manner (VP-modifying).\footnote{This line of reasoning, that
sentence-final adverbs could be represented by either $\beta$VPad and
$\beta$Sad depending on their interpretation, is inconsistent with the
reasoning given in 3.3 with regard to the syntax/semantics mapping. To
make the story consistent, we can represent all sentence final adverbs
as $\beta$Sad which can modify either the S or VP.} (9) also has two
interpretations: (a) For everyday, it is not the case that my car
starts on the first trial, where the adverb {\em everyday\/} takes the
scope over the whole sentence (S-modifying), (b) It is not the case
that my car starts on the first trial everyday, where {\em everyday\/}
takes the scope over the VP (VP-modifying).

The kind of treatment we give to adverbs here is very much in line
with the base-generation approach proposed by [Ernst 84], which
assumes all positions where an adverb can occur to be base-generated,
and the general type of content semantics of the adverbs specifies a
range of possible positions occupied by each adverb.

\subsubsection{Sentences with Auxiliaries}

In the previous section, we explained how order variation of adverbs
is represented. Roughly speaking, S-modifying adverbs occurring in
both sentence initial and final positions are represented by two
auxiliary trees $\beta$adS and $\beta$Sad.  However, S-modifying
adverbs can occur not only in sentence initial and final positions,
but also in any positions among auxiliaries (including the post
subject and pre main verb positions) as shown below:

\begin{verse}
(10) John ({\em probably\/}) has ({\em probably\/}) been ({\em
probably\/}) helping the homeless for years.\\
(11) He ({\em surely\/}) will ({\em surely\/}) pass the exam.\\
(12) John ({\em cleverly\/}) answered the questions.\footnote{In (12), 
the intended meaning is `It was clever that John answered the
questions,' although it has another interpretation `John answered the
question in a clever manner.'}
\end{verse}

In the current TAG system, we represent all the positions occupied by
the adverbs in (10) through (12) by the auxiliary tree
$\beta$adVP,\footnote{This treatment of adverbs among auxiliaries is
primarily based on the treatment of auxiliaries in the existing
system.} consequently S-modifying adverbs being assigned three
auxiliary tree sets, i.e.  $\beta$adS, $\beta$adVP, and $\beta$Sad.
For example, the sentence {\em John can probably drive a car\/} has
the derived tree (13):

\begin{verbatim}
(13)
                        S
                      /   \
                    NP     VP
                    |     /  \
                 John   V     VP*NA
                        |   /   \
                       can Ad    VP
                           |    /  \
                      probably V    NP
                               |    |
                             drive a car
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
Notice that the position occupied by the adverb {\em probably\/} in
(13) can also be occupied by a VP-modifying adverb. The ambiguity
becomes clear with the example (12), and the current system does not
give any structural way of disambiguating between the two readings,
unlike the case of sentence final adverbs, for which structural
distinction between VP-modifying and S-modifying reading is
made possible. I will discuss the inconsistency of treating adverbs in
the current system in the final section.

One thing, which we might have to consider but is not reflected in the
current system, is a (possible) restriction on the adjunction site of
VP-modifying adverbs. Consider examples in (14):

\begin{tabbing}
(14) \= a. \= I would have carefully driven the car \kill
     \> a. \> I would have carefully driven the car.\\
     \> b. \> *I would carefully have driven the car.
\end{tabbing}

\noindent
If the contrast between (14a) and (14b) must be ascribed to the
different property of VP- and S-modifying adverbs -- namely,
VP-modifying adverbs cannot occur among auxiliaries (except for
the pre-verbal position) while S-modifying adverbs can occur any of
the inter auxiliary position -- and the reason why (14b) is
unacceptable is because {\em carefully\/} which is a VP-modifying
adverb is between the two auxiliaries {\em would\/} and {\em have\/},
then we need a restriction on the adjunction to prevent the
ungrammatical tree (15d) from being derived:

\begin{verbatim}
(15)
    a.       S            b.      S
           /   \                /   \
         NP     VP            NP     VPr
         |     /  \           |     /  \
         I    V    NP         I   V     VP*NA
              |    |              |    /  \
           driven the car       have  V    NP
                                      |    |
                                    driven the car

    c.       S               d.      S
           /   \                   /   \
         NP     VP               NP     VP
         |     /  \              |     /  \
         I   Ad    VP*NA         I   V     VP*NA
             |    /  \               |    /  \
       carefully V     VP*NA      would Ad     VP*NA
                 |    /  \              |     /  \
               have  V    NP       carefully V    VP*NA
                     |    |                  |   /  \
                  driven the car           have V    NP
                                                |    |
                                            driven the car
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
We could take one of the following two options: The tree $\beta$adVP
with the feature [+vp]\footnote{This is a hypothetical feature in case
we really need the distinction.} is either obligatorily adjoined to
the main VP dominating V (and NP), or not adjoined to any of the aux
trees which dominate V and non-adjoinable VP. At the moment, the first
option seems to be easier to implement since the root node of VP tree
including a main verb is specified as VPr (as opposed to VP for aux
verbs) in the current system.
