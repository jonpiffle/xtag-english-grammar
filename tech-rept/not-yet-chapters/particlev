Particle verbs are another construction that is analyzed in the
English LTAG grammar with multicomponent anchors. The verb and particle act as a unit and their meaning is non-compositional.  


\enumsentence{They looked  up the number.} 
\enumsentence{They looked the number up.}
\enumsentence{They looked up the cliff.}
\enumsentence{*They looked the cliff up.}

Sentences (\ex{-3}) and (\ex{-2}) show the possibility of both base position and particle movement fro verb-particle constructions. Lexical items that serve
as particles can often also be used as prepositions with the same verbs. The verb-prepositional phrase  and verb-particle uses
have distinct interpretations and the prepositions cannot be moved as
shown in (\ex{-1}) and (\ex{0}). The english LTAG analysis has both the verb and the
particle as anchors. Tree families for transitive (and
di-transitive) particle verbs, include a tree with the particle
adjacent to the verb and one for each possible moved position for the
basic tree and each relevant extraction. So for example, the tree family for {\it call
up}, Tnx0Vplnx1, includes the following trees:
\begin{description}
\item nx0Vnx1pl
\item nx0Vplnx1
\item W0nx0Vplnx1
\item W0nx0Vnx1pl
\item Inx0Vnx1pl
\item Inx0Vplnx1
\item R0nx0Vnx1pl
\item R0nx0Vplnx1
\item W1nx0Vplnx1
\item R1nx0Vplnx1
\item N0nx0Vplnx1
\item N0nx0Vnx1pl
\item N1nx0Vplnx1
\item Gnx0Vplnx1
\item Gnx0Vnx1pl
\item Dnx0Vplnx1
\item nx1Vplbynx0
\item W0nx1Vplbynx0
\item pW0nx1Vplbynx0
\item W1nx1Vplbynx0
\item R0nx1Vplbynx0
\item pR0nx1Vplbynx0
\item N0nx1Vplbynx0
\item R1nx1Vplbynx0
\item N1nx1Vplbynx0
\end{description}

While particle movement provides an easy diagnostic for transitive
particle verbs, detecting intransive particle verbs is largely
dependent on semantic criteria. In intransitive constructions the
ambiguity between prepostions and particles is eliminated because of
the absence of an NP to complete the PP but there can still be ambiguity
with locative or directional adverbs as shown in (\ex{1}) and (\ex{2}).   

\enumsentence{The fire burned out before much damage was done.}
\enumsentence{The fire burned out toward the town.}
