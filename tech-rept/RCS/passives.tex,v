\label{passives}
In passive constructions such as (\ex{1}), the subject NP is
interpreted as having the same role as the direct object NP in the
corresponding active declarative (\ex{2}).

In a movement analysis, the direct object is said to have moved to the subject
position.  The original declarative subject is either absent in the passive or
is in a {\it by} headed PP ({\it by} phrase). In the English XTAG grammar,
passive constructions are handled by having separate trees within the
appropriate tree families.  Passive trees are found in most tree families that
have a direct object in the declarative tree (the light verb tree families, for
instance, do not contain passive trees).  Passive trees occur in pairs - one
tree with the {\it by} phrase, and another without it.  Variations in the
location of the {\it by} phrase are possible if a subcategorization includes
other arguments such as a PP or an indirect object. Additional trees are
required for these variations.  For example, the Sentential Complement with NP
tree family has three passive trees, shown in Figure~\ref{passive-trees}: one
without the {\it by}-phrase (Figure~\ref{passive-trees}(a)), one with the {\it
by} phrase before the sentential complement (Figure~\ref{passive-trees}(b)),
and one with the {\it by} phrase after the sentential complement
(Figure~\ref{passive-trees}(c)).

Figure~\ref{passive-trees}(a) also shows the feature restrictions imposed on
the anchor\footnote{A reduced set of features are shown for readability.}. Only
verbs with {\bf $<$mode$>$=ppart} (i.e. verbs with passive morphology) can
anchor this tree.  The {\bf $<$mode$>$} feature is also responsible for
requiring that passive {\it be} adjoin into the tree to create a matrix
sentence.  Since a requirement is imposed that all matrix sentences must have
{\bf $<$mode$>$=ind/imp}, an auxiliary verb that selects {\bf
$<$mode$>$=ppart} and {\bf $<$passive$>$=+} (such as {\it was}) must adjoin
(see Chapter~\ref{auxiliaries} for more information on the auxiliary verb
system).

 In a movement analysis, the direct object is said to have moved to
the subject position.  The original declarative subject is either
absent in the passive or is in a {\it by}-headed PP (by-phrase). In
the English LTAG grammar passive is having separate trees within the
appropriate tree families.  Passive trees are found in all tree
families that have a direct object in the declarative tree. Each of
these tree families has at least one passive tree with and one without
the by-phrase. Variations in the location of the by-phrase is possible
if a subcategorization includes other arguements such as a PP or
an indirect object. Additional trees are required for these variations
in {\bf by}-phrase location.  For example the tree family Tnx0Vnx1s2 will have
the passive trees shown in figures (\ref{passive1})-
(\ref{passive3}). Figure (\ref{passive1}) shows typical features for
the passive. The V node is required to have {\bf $<$passive$>=+$}
which has the effect of forcing adjunction of the passive {\it be}.
The other feature requirement on the V is that {\bf $,$mode$>=$ppart}
which has the effect of requiring it to have passive morphology.  Figures
(\ref{passive2}) and (\ref{passive3}) show variants in the location of
the by-phrase.
