@\chapter{Auxiliaries}
\label{auxiliaries}

Although there has been some debate about the lexical category of auxiliaries,
the English XTAG grammar follows \cite{mccawley88}, \cite{haegeman91}, and
others in classifying auxiliaries as verbs. The category of verbs can therefore
be divided into two sets, main or lexical verbs, and auxiliary verbs, which can
co-occur in a verbal sequence.  Only the highest verb in a verbal sequence is
marked for tense and agreement regardless of whether it is a main or auxiliary
verb.  Some auxiliaries ({\it be}, {\it do}, and {\it have}) share with main
verbs the property of having overt morphological marking for tense and
agreement, while the modal auxiliaries do not.  However, all auxiliary verbs
differ from main verbs in several crucial ways.

\begin{itemize}

\item Multiple auxiliaries can occur in a single sentence, while a matrix
sentence may have at most one main verb. 

\item Auxiliary verbs cannot occur as the sole verb in the sentence, but must
be followed by a main verb.

\item All auxiliaries precede the main verb in verbal sequences.

\item Auxiliaries do not subcategorize for any arguments.

\item Auxiliaries impose requirements on the morphological form of the verbs
that immediately follow them.

\item Only auxiliary verbs invert in questions (with the sole exception in 
American English of main verb {\it be}\footnote{Some dialects, particularly
British English, can also invert main verb {\it have} in yes/no questions
(e.g. {\it have you any Grey Poupon ?}).  This is usually attributed to the
influence of auxiliary {\it have}, coupled with the historic fact that English
once allowed this movement for all verbs.\label{have-footnote}}).

\item An auxiliary verb must precede sentential negation (e.g. $\ast${\it John not goes}).

\item Auxiliaries can form contractions with subjects and negation (e.g. {\it
he'll}, {\it won't}).

\end{itemize}

\noindent The restrictions that an auxiliary verb imposes on the succeeding verb limits
the sequence of verbs that can occur.  In English, sequences of up to five
verbs are allowed, as in sentence (\ex{1}).

\enumsentence{The music should have been being played [for the president] .}

\noindent 
The required ordering of verb forms when all five verbs are present is:

\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{ccl}
& & {\bf modal base perfective progressive passive}
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\noindent
The rightmost verb is the main verb of the sentence.  While a main verb
subcategorizes for the arguments that appear in the sentence, the auxiliary
verbs select the particular morphological forms of the verb to follow each of
them.  The auxiliaries included in the English XTAG grammar are listed in Table
\ref{aux-table} by type.  The third column of Table \ref{aux-table} lists the
verb forms that are required to follow each type of auxiliary verb.

\section{Non-inverted sentences}
\label{aux-non-inverted}

This section and the sections that follow describe how the English XTAG grammar
accounts for properties of the auxiliary system described above.

In our grammar, auxiliary trees are added to the main verb tree by adjunction.
Figure~\ref{Vvx} shows the adjunction tree for non-inverted
sentences.

\end{tabular}
\caption{Auxiliary trees for {\it The music should have been being played .}}
\label{anchored-aux-trees}
\end{figure}

The restrictions outlined in column 3 of Table \ref{aux-table} are
implemented through the features {\bf $<$mode$>$}, {\bf
$<$perfect$>$}, {\bf $<$progressive$>$} and {\bf $<$passive$>$}.
The syntactic lexicon entries for the auxiliaries give values for
these features on the foot node~(VP$^{*}$) in Figure~\ref{Vvx}.  Since
the top features of the foot node must eventually unify with the
bottom features of the node it adjoins onto for the sentence to be
valid, this enforces the restrictions made by the auxiliary node.  In
addition to these feature values, each auxiliary also gives values to
the anchoring node~(V$\diamond$), to be passed up the tree to the root
VP~(VP$_{r}$) node; there they will become the new features for the
top VP node of the sentential tree.  Another auxiliary may now adjoin
on top of it, and so forth.  These feature values thereby ensure the
proper auxiliary sequencing.  Figure~\ref{anchored-aux-trees} shows the auxiliary trees anchored by the four 
auxiliary verbs in sentence (\ex{0}).  Figure~\ref{non-inverted-sentence} shows
the final tree created for this sentence.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c}
{\psfig{figure=ps/auxs-files/non-inverted-sentence.ps,height=4.1in}}
\end{tabular}
\caption{{\it The music should have been being played .}}
\label{non-inverted-sentence}
\end{figure}

The general English restriction that matrix clauses must have tense
(or be imperatives) is enforced by requiring the top S-node of a
sentence to have {\bf $<$mode$>$=ind/imp} (indicative or imperative).
Since only the indicative and imperative sentences have tense,
non-tensed clauses are restricted to occurring in embedded
environments.

Noun-verb contractions are labeled NVC in their part-of-speech field
in the morphological database and then undergo special processing to
split them apart into the noun and the reduced verb before
parsing. The noun then selects its trees in the normal fashion. The
contraction, say {\it 'll} or {\it 'd}, likewise selects the normal
auxiliary verb tree, $\beta$Vvx. However, since the contracted form,
rather than the verb stem, is given in the morphology, the contracted
form must also be listed as a separate syntactic entry. These entries
have all the same features of the full form of the auxiliary verbs,
with tense constraints coming from the morphological entry (e.g. {\it
it's} is listed as {\sc it 's NVC 3sg PRES}). The ambiguous
contractions {\it 'd} ({\it had/would}) and {\it 's} ({\it has/is})
behave like other ambiguous lexical items; there are simply multiple
entries for those lexical items in the lexicon, each with different
features. In the resulting parse, the contracted form is shown with
features appropriate to the full auxiliary it represents.

\section{Inverted Sentences}

In main clause yes-no questions and non-subject-extracted wh-questions in English, the first (matrix) auxiliary appears
before the subject, as shown in \ex{1} and \ex{2}.

\enumsentence{Will John buy a backpack?}
\enumsentence{What will John buy?}

In this case, the tree anchored by the auxiliary verb will adjoin to S, rather
than VP. The relevant tree is shown in Figure~\ref{inverted-trees}
Figure~\ref{yes/no-question} shows
this tree (anchored by {\it will}) and adjoined to the declarative transitive
tree\footnote{The declarative transitive tree was seen in
section~\ref{nx0Vnx1-family}.} which is anchored by main verb {\it buy}.


\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c}
{\psfig{figure=ps/auxs-files/betaVs-with-features.ps,height=4.2in}} 
\end{tabular}
\caption{Tree for auxiliary verb inversion: $\beta$Vs}
\label{inverted-trees}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c}
{\psfig{figure=ps/auxs-files/yes-no-question.ps,height=3.6in}} \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{{\it will John buy a backpack ?}}
\label{yes/no-question}
\end{figure}

%The feature {\bf $<$displ-const$>$} ensures that both of the trees in
%Figure~\ref{inverted-trees} must adjoin to an elementary tree whenever one of
%them does. For more discussion on this mechanism, which simulates tree local
%multi-component adjunction, see \cite{hockeysrini93}.  The tree in
%Figure~\ref{inverted-trees}(b), anchored by $\epsilon$, represents the
%originating position of the inverted auxiliary. Its adjunction blocks the {\bf
%$<$assign-case$>$} values of the VP it dominates from being co-indexed with the
%{\bf $<$case$>$} value of the subject. Since {\bf $<$assign-case$>$} values
%from the VP are blocked, the {\bf $<$case$>$} value of the subject can only be
%co-indexed with the {\bf $<$assign-case$>$} value of the inverted auxiliary
%(Figure~\ref{inverted-trees}(a)).  Consequently, the inverted auxiliary
%functions as the case-assigner for the subject in these inverted structures.
%This is in contrast to the situation in uninverted structures where the anchor
%of the highest (leftmost) VP assigns case to the subject (see
%section~\ref{case-for-verbs} for more on case assignment).  The XTAG analysis
%is similar to GB accounts where the inverted auxiliary plus the
%$\epsilon$-anchored tree are taken as representing I to C movement.

\section{Do-Support}

As discussed in the previous section, subject-auxiliary inversion targets the
highest auxiliary in the clause. Similarly, negation always occurs after the
highest auxiliary. When there is no auxiliary verb in the clause, a dummy
auxiliary {\it do} is inserted, a mechanism known as `do-support'. It is this
dummy auxiliary that undergoes inversion in questions and supports negation in
negative sentences. 

\enumsentence{John bought a backpack .}
\enumsentence{$\ast$Bought John a backpack ?}
\enumsentence{Did John buy a packpack ?}

\enumsentence{$\ast$John bought not a backpack .}
\enumsentence{$\ast$John not bought a backpack .}
\enumsentence{John did not buy a backpack .}


%\enumsentence {John does not want a car .}
%\enumsentence {$\ast$John not wants a car .}
%\enumsentence {John will not want a car .}
%\enumsentence {Do you want to leave home ?}
%\enumsentence {$\ast$want you to leave home ?}
%\enumsentence {will you want to leave home ?}

\subsection{In negated sentences}
\label{do-support-negatives}

The GB analysis of do-support in negated sentences hinges on the separation of
the INFL and VP nodes (see \cite{chomsky65}, \cite{jackendoff72} and
\cite{chomsky86}).  The claim is that the presence of the negative morpheme
blocks the main verb from getting tense from the INFL node, thereby forcing the
addition of a verbal lexeme to carry the inflectional elements.  If an
auxiliary verb is present, then it carries tense, but if not, periphrastic or
`dummy', {\it do} is required.  This seems to indicate that {\it do} and other
auxiliary verbs would not co-occur, and indeed this is the case (see sentences
(\ex{1})-(\ex{2})).  Auxiliary {\it do} is allowed in English when no
negative morpheme is present, but this usage is marked as emphatic.  Emphatic
{\it do} is also not allowed to co-occur with auxiliary verbs (sentences
(\ex{3})-(\ex{6})).

\enumsentence {$\ast$We will have do bought a sleeping bag .}
\enumsentence {$\ast$We do will have bought a sleeping bag .}
\enumsentence {You {\bf do} have a backpack, don't you ?}
\enumsentence {I {\bf do} want to go !}
\enumsentence {$\ast$You {\bf do} can have a backpack, don't you ?}
\enumsentence {$\ast$I {\bf did} have had a backpack !}

%%%At present, the XTAG grammar does not have analyses for emphatic {\it do}.%%

In the XTAG grammar, {\it do} is prevented from co-occurring with other
auxiliary verbs by a requirement that it adjoin only onto main verbs
({\bf $<$mainv$>$ = $+$}).  It has
indicative mode, so no other auxiliaries can adjoin above it.\footnote{Earlier,
we said that indicative mode carries tense with it.  Since only the topmost
auxiliary carries the tense, any subsequent verbs must {\bf not} have
indicative mode.}  The lexical item {\it not} is only allowed to adjoin onto a
non-indicative (and therefore non-tensed) verb.  Since all matrix clauses must
be indicative (or imperative), a negated sentence will fail unless an auxiliary
verb, either {\it do} or another auxiliary, adjoins somewhere above the
negative morpheme, {\it not}. In addition to forcing adjunction of an
auxiliary, this analysis of {\it not} allows it freedom to move around in the
auxiliaries, as seen in the sentences (\ex{1})-(\ex{4}).

\enumsentence {John will have had a backpack .}
\enumsentence {$\ast$John not will have had a backpack .}
\enumsentence {John will not have had a backpack .}
\enumsentence {John will have not had a backpack .}

\subsection{In inverted yes/no questions}

In inverted yes/no questions, {\it do} is required if there is no auxiliary
verb to invert, as seen in sentences (\ex{-12})-(\ex{-10}), replicated here
as (\ex{1})-(\ex{3}).

\enumsentence {do you want to leave home ?}
\enumsentence {$\ast$want you to leave home ?}
\enumsentence {will you want to leave home ?}
\enumsentence {$\ast$do you will want to leave home ?}

In English, unlike other Germanic languages, the main verb cannot move to the
beginning of a clause, with the exception of main verb {\it be}.\footnote{The
inversion of main verb {\it have} in British English was previously noted.}  In
a GB account of inverted yes/no questions, the tense feature is said to be in
C$^{0}$ at the front of the sentence.  Since main verbs cannot move, they
cannot pick up the tense feature, and do-support is again required if there is
no auxiliary verb to perform the role.  Sentence (\ex{0}) shows that {\it do}
does not interact with other auxiliary verbs, even when in the inverted
position.

In XTAG, trees anchored by a main verb that lacks tense are required to have an
auxiliary verb adjoin onto them, whether at the VP node to form a declarative
sentence, or at the S node to form an inverted question.  {\it Do} selects the
inverted auxiliary trees given in Figure~\ref{inverted-trees}, just as other
auxiliaries do, so it is available to adjoin onto a tree at the S node to form
a yes/no question.  The mechanism described in
section~\ref{do-support-negatives} prohibits {\it do} from co-occurring with
other auxiliary verbs, even in the inverted position.


\section{Infinitives}

The infinitive {\it to} is considered an auxiliary verb in the XTAG system, and
selects the auxiliary tree in Figure~\ref{Vvx}.  {\it To}, like {\it do}, does
not interact with the other auxiliary verbs, adjoining only to main verb base
forms, and carrying infinitive mode.  It is used in embedded clauses, both with
and without a complementizer, as in sentences (\ex{1})-(\ex{3}).  Since it
cannot be inverted, it simply does not select the trees in
Figure~\ref{inverted-trees}.

\enumsentence {John wants to have a backpack .}
\enumsentence {John wants Mary to have a backpack .}
\enumsentence {John wants for Mary to have a backpack .}

The usage of infinitival {\em to} interacts closely with the distribution of
null subjects (PRO), and is described in more detail in
section~\ref{for-complementizer}.

\section{Semi-Auxiliaries}

Under the category of semi-auxiliaries, we have placed several verbs that do
not seem to closely follow the behavior of auxiliaries.  One of these 
auxiliaries, {\it dare}, mainly behaves as a modal and selects for the base 
form of the verb.  The other semi-auxiliaries all select for the infinitival 
form of the verb.  Examples of this second type of semi-auxiliary are {\it 
used to}, {\it ought to}, {\it get to}, {\it have to}, {\it BE to} and {\it
BE about to}.  

\subsection{Marginal Modal {\it dare}}

The auxiliary {\it dare} is unique among modals in that it both allows
DO-support and exhibits a past tense form.  It clearly falls in modal position
since no other auxiliary (except {\it do}) may precede it in linear
order\footnote{Some speakers accept {\it dare} preceded by a modal, as in {\it
I might dare finish this report today}.  In the XTAG analysis, this particular
double modal usage is accounted for.  Other cases of double modal occurrence
exist in some dialects of American English,  although these are not accounted
for in the system, as was mentioned earlier.\label{dare-footnote}}.  Examples appear below.

\enumsentence{she {\bf dare} not have been seen .}
\enumsentence{she does not {\bf dare} succeed .}
\enumsentence{Jerry {\bf dared} not eat the strawberries .}
\enumsentence{only models {\bf dare} wear such extraordinary outfits .}
\enumsentence{{\bf dare} Dale tell Mary the secret ?}
\enumsentence{$\ast$Louise had dared not tell a soul .}

As mentioned above, auxiliaries are prevented from having DO-support within the
XTAG system.  To allow for DO-support in this case, we had to create a lexical
entry for {\it dare} that allowed it to have the feature {\bf
mainv+} and to have {\bf base} mode (this measure is
what also allows {\it dare} to occur in double-modal sequences).  A second
lexical entry was added to handle the regular modal occurrence of {\it dare}.
Additionally, all other modals are classified as being present tense, while
{\it dare} has both present and past forms.  To handle this behavior, {\it
dare} was given similar features to the other modals in the morphology minus
the specification for tense. 

\subsection{Other semi-auxiliaries}

The other semi-auxiliaries all select for the infinitival form of the verb.
Many of these auxiliaries allow for DO-support and can appear in both base and
past participle forms, in addition to being able to stand alone (indicative 
mode).  Examples of this type appear below.

\enumsentence{Alex {\bf used} to attend karate workshops .}
\enumsentence{Angelina might have {\bf used} to believe in fate .}
\enumsentence{Rich did not {\bf used} to want to be a physical therapist .}
\enumsentence{Mick might not {\bf have} to play the game tonight .}
\enumsentence{Singer {\bf had} to have been there .}
\enumsentence{Heather has {\bf got} to finish that project before she goes
insane .}

The auxiliaries {\it ought to} and {\it BE to} may not be preceded by any other
auxiliary.  

\enumsentence{Biff {\bf ought} to have been working tonight .}
\enumsentence{$\ast$Carson does {\bf ought} to have been working tonight .}
\enumsentence{the party {\bf is} to take place tonight .}
\enumsentence{$\ast$the party had {\bf been} to take place tonight .}

The trickiest element in this group of auxiliaries is {\it used to}.  While the
other verbs behave according to standard inflection for auxiliaries, {\it used
to} has the same form whether it is in mode base, past participle, or
indicative forms.  The only connection {\it used to} maintains with the
infinitival form {\it use} is that occasionally, the bare form {\it use} will
appear with DO-support.  Since the three modes mentioned above are mutually
exclusive in terms of both the morphology and the lexicon, {\it used} has three
entries in each.\\ 

Semi-auxiliaries like {\it BE about to} are modal expressions derived from
adverbs like {\it about}, which select for {\it BE} as the immediately
preceding auxiliary and for infinitive {\it to} as the following one. This
is illustrated in the following examples:

\enumsentence{The party cannot possibly {\it be about to} begin just yet .}
\enumsentence{Miranda {\it is about to} steal the gun .}
\enumsentence{I consider Miranda {\it about to} be upset .}

In order to handle these expressions, we have auxiliary trees anchored by
the word from which the modal expression is derived. So, for {\it BE about
to}, {\it about} anchors the $\beta$Vvx-arb tree with its {\bf $<$mode$>$}
value set to {\bf nom} (Figure~\ref{fig:semi-aux-about}) and selects for
the infinitive VP, {\it to}, with the following equation: {\bf
VP.b:$<$mode$>$=inf}.

In addition to the above constraint that restricts the form of the verb
selected by the $\beta$Vvx-arb tree to be infinitive, there is another
constraint that needs to be accounted for, namely, the selection of {\it
BE} as the immediately preceding auxiliary. This is especially needed to
rule out examples like \ex{1} and \ex{2}:

\enumsentence{??John seems about to leave .}
\enumsentence{*Mary could about to solve the problem .}

{\it Seems} is a raising verb that can select for VP's which have {\bf
$<$mode$>$ = nom} ({\it Miranda seems ready}) and will therefore be able to
incorrectly adjoin to the root VP node of the $\beta$Vvx-arb tree anchored
by {\it about}.\footnote{%
%
Adjectival predicates project to a VP with the equation {\bf
$<$mode$>$=nom} on the VP node. See Chapter~\ref{small-clauses} for the
XTAG analysis of adjectival predicative constructions and the associated
feature structures and equations.%
%
} We are able to rule \ex{-1} out because of the special status of raising
verbs like {\it seems}. Though the raising verbs are treated like the other
auxiliary verbs in that they select the same tree,$\beta$Vvx, they are
different in that the value for their {\bf $<$mainv$>$} feature is {\bf +},
whereas it is {\bf -} for the other auxiliaires. We simply add the feature
equation {\bf $<$mainv$>$=-} in the top node of the root VP in the
$\beta$Vvx-arb tree. As a result only auxiliaries that come with the same
binary feature value will be able to adjoin in.

\begin{figure}[htb]

\end{tabular}
\caption{Auxiliary Tree for Semi-auxiliary anchored by {\it about}: $\beta$Vvx-arb}
\label{fig:semi-aux-about}
\end{figure}

To further disallow auxiliaries other than {\it BE} from selecting the
$\beta$Vvx-arb tree, as illustrated in \ex{0} above, we have an additional
lexical entry for {\it BE} which selects for a VP with the feature equation
{\bf VP.b:$<$mode$>$=nom}. Since no other auxiliary has this equation in
the tree it anchors (except for raising verbs which are independently ruled
out by the mechanism described above), the grammar correctly excludes
examples like \ex{0}.


\subsection{Other Issues}

There is a lingering problem with the auxiliaries that stems from the fact that
there currently is no way to distinguish between the main verb and auxiliary verb
behaviors for a given letter string within the morphology.  This situation
results in many unacceptable sentences being successfully parsed by the system.
Examples of the unacceptable sentences are given below.

\enumsentence{the miller {\bf cans} tell a good story .  (vs  the farmer {\bf
cans} peaches in July .)}
\enumsentence{David {\bf wills} have finished by noon .  (vs  the old man {\bf
wills} his fortune to me .)}
\enumsentence{Sarah {\bf needs} not leave .  (vs  Sarah {\bf needs} to leave .)}
\enumsentence{Jennifer {\bf dares} not be seen .  (vs  the young woman {\bf
dares} him to do the stunt .)}
\enumsentence{Lila {\bf does use} to like beans .  (vs  Lila {\bf does use} her
new cookware .)}

In inverted sentences, the two trees shown in Figure~\ref{inverted-trees}
adjoin to an S tree anchored by a main verb.  The tree in
Figure~\ref{inverted-trees}(a) is anchored by the auxiliary verb and adjoins to
the S node, while the tree in Figure~\ref{inverted-trees}(b) is anchored by an
empty element and adjoins at the VP node.  Figure~\ref{yes/no-question} shows
these trees (anchored by {\it will}) adjoined to the declarative transitive

The feature {\bf $<$displ-const$>$} ensures that both of the trees in
Figure~\ref{inverted-trees} must adjoin to an elementary tree whenever one of
them does. For more discussion on this mechanism, which simulates tree local
multi-component adjunction, see \cite{hockeysrini93}.  The tree in
Figure~\ref{inverted-trees}(b), anchored by $\epsilon$, represents the
originating position of the inverted auxiliary. Its adjunction blocks the {\bf
$<$assign-case$>$} values of the VP it dominates from being co-indexed with the
{\bf $<$case$>$} value of the subject. Since {\bf $<$assign-case$>$} values
from the VP are blocked, the {\bf $<$case$>$} value of the subject can only be
co-indexed with the {\bf $<$assign-case$>$} value of the inverted auxiliary
(Figure~\ref{inverted-trees}(a)).  Consequently, the inverted auxiliary
functions as the case-assigner for the subject in these inverted structures.
This is in contrast to the situation in uninverted structures where the anchor
of the highest (leftmost) VP assigns case to the subject (see
section~\ref{case-for-verbs} for more on case assignment).  The XTAG analysis
is similar to GB accounts where the inverted auxiliary plus the
$\epsilon$-anchored tree are taken as representing I to C movement.

In the XTAG grammar, {\it do} is prevented from cooccurring with
other auxiliary verbs by a requirement that it adjoin only onto main
verbs.  It has indicative mode, so no other auxiliaries can adjoin
above it\footnote{Earlier, we said that indicative mode carries tense
with it.  Since only the topmost auxiliary carries the tense, any
subsequent verbs must {\bf not} have indicative mode.}.  The lexical
item {\it not} is only allowed to adjoin onto an non-indicative (and
therefore non-tensed) verbs.  Since all matrix clauses must be
indicative (or imperative), a negated sentence will fail unless an
auxiliary verb, either {\it do} or another auxiliary, adjoins
somewhere above the negative morpheme, {\it not}. In addition to
forcing adjunction of an auxiliary, this analysis of {\it not} allows
it freedom to move around in the auxiliaries, as seen in the sentences
(\ex{1})-(\ex{4}).

The restrictions outlined in Column 3 of Table \ref{aux-table} are implemented
through the features {\it $<$mode$>$}, {\it $<$perfective$>$}, {\it
$<$progressive$>$}, and {\it $<$passive$>$}.  The syntactic lexicon entries for
the auxiliaries gives values for these features on the foot node~(VP$_{*}$) in
Figure \ref{Vvx}.  Since the top features of the foot node must unify with the
bottom features of the node it adjoins onto for the sentence to be valid, this
enforces the restrictions made by the auxiliary node.  In addition to these
feature values, each auxiliary also gives values to the anchoring
node~(V$\diamond$), to be passed up the tree to the root VP~(VP$_{r}$) node;
there they will become the new features for the top VP node of the sentential
tree.  Another auxiliary may now adjoin on top of it, and so forth.  These
feature values thereby ensure the proper auxiliary sequencing.  Figure
\ref{anchored-aux-trees} shows the auxiliary trees anchored by the 4 auxiliary
verbs in sentence (\ex{0}).  Figure \ref{non-inverted-sentence} shows the
final tree created for this sentence.

The feature {\it $<$displ-const$>$} ensures that both of the trees in Figure
\ref{inverted-trees} must adjoin to an elementary tree whenever one of them does. For
more discussion on this mechanism, which simulates tree local multi-component
adjunction, see \cite{hockeysrini93} [NOTE: refer to section in this report, if
we include it].  Tree \ref{inverted-trees}b, anchored by $\epsilon$, represents
the originating position of the inverted auxiliary. Its adjunction blocks the
{\it $<$assign-case$>$} values of the VP it dominates from being coindexed with
the {\it $<$case$>$} value of the subject. Since {\it $<$assign-case$>$} values
from the VP are blocked, the {\it $<$case$>$} value of the subject can only be
coindexed with the {\it $<$assign-case$>$} value of the inverted auxiliary
(Tree \ref{inverted-trees}a).  Consequently, the inverted auxiliary functions
as the case-assigner for the subject in these inverted structures.  This is in
contrast to the situation in uninverted structures where the anchor of the
highest (leftmost) VP assigns case to the subject (see Section
\ref{case-for-verbs} for more on case assignment).  The XTAG analysis is similar to
GB accounts where the inverted auxiliary plus the $\epsilon$-anchored tree are
taken as representing I to C movement.

\enumsentence {*I {\bf did} have had a backpack!}
d261 14
a274 11
In the XTAG grammar, {\it do} is prevented from co-occurring with other
auxiliary verbs by a requirement that it adjoin only onto main verbs.  It has
indicative mode, so no other auxiliaries can adjoin above it\footnote{Earlier,
we said that indicative mode carries tense with it.  Since only the topmost
auxiliary carries the tense, any subsequent verbs must {\bf not} have
indicative mode.}.  {\it Do} or another auxiliary is required to adjoin on top
of a negative morpheme by allowing {\it not} to only adjoin onto an
non-indicative (and therefore non-tensed) verb.  Since all matrix clauses must
be indicative (or imperative), a negative sentence will fail without an
auxiliary verb.  This analysis allows {\it not} the freedom to move around in
the auxiliaries, as seen in the sentences (\ex{1}) - (\ex{4}).

The usage of inifinitival {\em to} interacts closely with the
distribution of null subjects (PRO), and is described in more detail
in Section \ref{for-complementizer}.

Although there has been some debate about the lexical category of auxiliaries, the English LTAG grammar follows McCawley(1988), Hageman(1991) and others in classifying auxiliaries as verbs. The category of verbs can therefore be divided into two sets, main or lexical verbs and auxiliary verbs. At least some auxiliaries share with lexical verbs the property  of having morphological marking for tense and agreement.  In addition, only the leftmost verb in a verbal sequence is morphologically marked for tense and argreement  regardless of whether it is a main or auxiliary verb. However, auxiliary verbs differ from lexical verbs in several crucial ways. 
d4 10
a13 2
\begin{enumerate}
\item Multiple auxiliaries can occur in a single sentence, while a matrix sentence may have at most one lexical verb. 
d15 1
a15 1
\item All auxiliaries preceed the lexical verb in verbal sequences
d17 2
a18 1
\item Auxiliaries do not subcategorize for NP, PP or S arguments
d20 2
a21 1
\item Auxiliaries impose requirements on the morphological form of the verbs that immediately follow them.
d23 1
a23 2
\item Only auxiliary verbs invert in questions (with the sole
exception in American English of main verb {\it be}).
d25 1
a25 1
\item Sentential negation requires an auxiliary verb (e.g. *{\it John not goes}).
d27 2
a28 1
\item Auxiliaries can form contractions with subjects, and with negation.

\end{enumerate}

The sections that follow describe how the English LTAG implementation accounts for these properties of the auxiliary system.
d42 1
a43 1
Auxiliary verbs, in contrast to main verbs, do not  occur as the sole verb in a sentence but must be followed by another verb. Verbal sequences in English are limited to a maximum length, in contrast to a language like French in which modals can be recursively added to a sentence. English allows sequences of up to five verbs as shown in (\ex{1})

d49 1

The required ordering of verb forms is:
d51 2
a52 3
\begin{description}
\item {\bf modal base perfective progressive passive}
\end{description}
d54 5
a58 8
The rightmost verb is the main verb of the sentence.  The main verb's
subcategorization requirements determine the arguments that will appear in the
sentence.  Rather than selecting arguments, auxiliary verbs select particular
morphological forms of verbs to follow them.  What  verb form is required
varies by type of auxiliary verb.  The auxiliaries included in the English
LTAG grammar are listed in Table (\ref{aux-table}) by type.  The third column
of Table (\ref{aux-table}) lists the verb forms that are required to follow
each type of auxiliary verb.

In the English LTAG grammar, the tree anchored by the main verb
supplies the structure for the verb and its subcategorized arguments.
Other trees are added to it by substitution or adjunction.  Auxiliary
verbs in uninverted sentences anchor the auxiliary tree shown in
Figure \ref{vVX} which adjoins to a VP.

In inverted sentences, two trees adjoin to the tree anchored by the
main verb: $\beta$vS anchored by the auxiliary verb and $\beta$vVX
anchored by an empty element Figure \ref{inv-set}.

 The feature {\bf $<$disp-const$>$} ensures that both of the trees in
Figure \ref{inv-set} must adjoin to an elementary tree whenever one of
them does. For more discussion of this mechanism, which simulates tree
local multi-component adjunction see \cite{BAH-Srini}.  The $\beta$vVX
tree anchored by $\epsilon$ represents the base position of the
inverted auxiliary. It's adjunction blocks the {\bf assign-case}
values of VP's dominated by $\epsilon$-anchored VP from being
coindexed with the {\bf $<$case$>$} value of the subject. Since {\bf
assign-case} values from the VP are blocked, the {\bf $<$case$>$}
value of the subject can only be coindexed with the {\bf
$<$assign-case$>$} value of the inverted auxiliary.  Consequently, the
inverted auxiliary fuctions as the case-assigner for the subject in
these inverted structures in contrast to the situation in univerted
structures where the anchor of the highest VP assigns case to the
subject.  This account is similar to GB accounts if the highest VP is
taken as roughly corresponding to IP and the inverted auxiliary plus
$\epsilon$-anchored $\beta$vVX are taken as representing I to C
movement.

The requirements in Table (\ref{aux-table}) are implemented through the
multi-valued {\bf $<$mode$>$} feature and by the binary features {\bf
$<$perf$>$}, {\bf $<$prog$>$},  and {\bf $<$passive$>$} . The synatctic lexicon
entries for the auxiliaries include values for {\bf mode}, {\bf
pass}, {\bf prog}, and {\bf perf}  features on the VP foot node of
$\alpha$vVX.  These feature values ensure the proper auxiliary
sequencing.  Examples of syntactic entries for auxiliaries are shown
in

 As can be seen in (\ref{vVX}) the root VP node inherits {\bf $<$tense$>$}, {\bf $<$mode$>$} and
{\bf $<$agr$>$} values from its auxiliary verb anchor, so the compound VP is
of the same variety as its leftmost verb. The feature values on the
VP foot node enforce the restrictions shown in Table (\ref{}) column 3.
Main clauses must have tense. The feature {\bf $<$tense$>$} only has values
specified for verbs that are also {\bf $<$mode$>$= ind} or {\bf $<$mode$>$= imp}, so by requiring one of these values for mode, tense is also required.  The parser enforces the restriction that main clauses must have tense by requiring the top S-node of a sentence to have {\bf $<$mode$>$= ind/imp}.  Since only tensed sentences can have {\bf $<$mode$>$=ind} and only imperatives can have {\bf $<$mode$>$=imp}, non-tensed clauses are restricted to occuring in embedded environments.
