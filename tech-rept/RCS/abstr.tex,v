@for new release: changed the statement that the current grammar supersedes 1998 release, rather than 95

@\begin{abstract} 

This document describes a sizable grammar of English written in the TAG
formalism and implemented for use with the XTAG system. This report and the
grammar described herein supersedes the TAG grammar described in
\cite{tech-rept98}. The English grammar described in this report is based
on the TAG formalism developed in \cite{joshi75}, which has been extended
to include lexicalization (\cite{schabes88}), and unification-based feature
structures (\cite{vijay91}).  The range of syntactic phenomena that can be
handled is large and includes auxiliaries (including inversion), copula,
raising and small clause constructions, topicalization, relative clauses,
infinitives, gerunds, passives, adjuncts, ditransitives (and datives),
ergatives, it-clefts, wh-clefts, PRO constructions, noun-noun
modifications, extraposition, determiner sequences, genitives, negation,
noun-verb contractions, sentential adjuncts, imperatives and resultatives.
The XTAG grammar is continuously updated with the addition of new analyses
and modification of old ones, and an online version of this report can be
found at the XTAG web page: {\tt http://www.cis.upenn.edu/\~{}xtag/}.

This paper presents a sizable grammar of English written in the TAG
formalism and implemented for use with the XTAG system. The version of
TAG used in this  grammar is lexicalized (Schabes, Abeille, Joshi
1988) and feature-based (Vijay-Shankar, Joshi 1988).  The grammar
discussed in this report extends the grammar presented in Abeille,
Bishop, Cote and Schabes (1990) in at least two ways. First, this
grammar has more detailed linguistic analysis, and second the grammar presented in this paper is fully implemented.
