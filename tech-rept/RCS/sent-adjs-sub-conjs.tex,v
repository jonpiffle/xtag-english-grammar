@\chapter{Adjunct Clauses}
\label{adjunct-cls}
\label{sub-conj}

Adjunct clauses include subordinate clauses (i.e. those with overt
subordinating conjunctions), purpose clauses and participial adjuncts.

Subordinating conjunctions each select four trees, allowing them to
appear in four different positions relative to the matrix clause.  The
positions are (1) before the matrix clause, (2) after the matrix
clause, (3) before the VP, surrounded by two punctuation marks, and
(4) after the matrix clause, separated by a punctuation mark. Each of
these trees is shown in Figure \ref{sub-conj-trees}.

\begin{figure}[htb]

\end{tabular}
\caption{Auxiliary Trees for Subordinating Conjunctions}
\label{sub-conj-trees}
\end{figure}

Sentence-initial adjuncts adjoin at the root S of the matrix clause,
while sentence-final adjuncts adjoin at a VP node. In this, the XTAG
analysis follows the findings on the attachment sites of adjunct
clauses for conditional clauses (\cite{iatridou91}) and for
infinitival clauses (\cite{Browning87}). One compelling argument is
based on Binding Condition C effects.  As can be seen from examples
(\ex{1})-(\ex{3}) below, no Binding Condition violation occurs when
the adjunct is sentence initial, but the subject of the matrix clause
clearly governs the adjunct clause when it is in sentence final
position and co-indexation of the pronoun with the subject of the
adjunct clause is impossible.

\enumsentence{Unless she$_i$ hurries, Mary$_i$ will be late for the meeting.}
\enumsentence{$\ast$She$_i$ will be late for the meeting unless Mary$_i$ hurries.}
\enumsentence{Mary$_i$ will be late for the meeting unless she$_i$ hurries.}

%Tree families with direct objects also contain a pair for the passive trees,
%and the transitive family (Tnx0Vnx1) contains a pair for the ergative
%trees. All of these trees are anchored by the main verb of the adjunct clause,
%and adjoin either at S or VP to the matrix clause.  Subordinating conjunctions
%adjoin to these sentential adjunct trees, as described in section
%\ref{sub-conj} below.  If no conjunction adjoins, only certain modes are
%licensed for the adjunct clause.  These are described immediately below.

We had previously treated subordinating conjunctions as a subclass of
{\em conjunction}, but are now assigning them the POS {\em
preposition}, as there is such clear overlap between words that
function as prepositions (taking NP complements) and subordinating
conjunctions (taking clausal complements). While there are some
prepositions which only take NP complements and some which only take
clausal complements, many take both as shown in examples
(\ex{1})-(\ex{4}), and it seems to be artificial to assign them two
different parts-of-speech.

\enumsentence{Helen left before the party.}
\enumsentence{Helen left before the party began.}
\enumsentence{Since the election, Bill has been elated.}
\enumsentence{Since winning the election, Bill has been elated.}

Each subordinating conjunction selects the values of the {\bf
$<$mode$>$} and {\bf $<$comp$>$} features of the subordinated S. The
{\bf $<$mode$>$} value constrains the types of clauses the
subordinating conjunction may appear with and the {\bf $<$comp$>$}
value constrains the complementizers which may adjoin to that
clause. For instance, indicative subordinate clauses may appear with
the complementizer {\it that} as in (\ex{1}), while participial
clauses may not have any complementizers (\ex{2}).

\enumsentence{Midge left that car so that Sam could drive to work.}
\enumsentence{*Since that seeing the new VW, Midge could think of
nothing else.}

\subsection{Multi-word Subordinating Conjunctions}

We extracted a list of multi-word conjunctions, such as {\it as if},
{\it in order}, and {\it for all (that)}, from \cite{quirk85}. For the
most part, the components of the complex are all anchors, as shown in
Figures~\ref{conjs}(a). In one case, {\it as ADV as}, there is a great
deal of latitude in the choice of adverb, so this is a substitution
site (Figures~\ref{conjs}(b)). This multi-anchor treatment is very
similar to that proposed for idioms in \cite{AS89}, and the analysis
of light verbs in the XTAG grammar (see section~\ref{nx0lVN1-family}).

\end{figure}

\section{``Bare'' Adjunct Clauses}

``Bare'' adjunct clauses do not have an overt subordinating
conjunction, but are typically parallel in meaning to clauses with
subordinating conjunctions. For this reason, we have elected to handle
them using the same trees shown above, but with null anchors. They are
selected at the same time and in the same way the {\it PRO} tree is,
as they all have {\it PRO} subjects.  Three values of {\bf $<$mode$>$}
are licensed: {\bf inf} (infinitive), {\bf ger} (gerundive) and {\bf
ppart} (past participal).\footnote{We considered allowing bare
indicative clauses, such as {\it He died that others may live}, but
these were considered too archaic to be worth the additional ambiguity
they would add to the grammar.} They interact with complementizers as
follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Participial complements do not license any
complementizers:\footnote{While these sound a bit like extraposed
relative clauses (see \cite{kj87}), those move only to the right and
adjoin to S; as these clauses are equally grammatical both
sentence-initially and sentence-finally, we are analyzing them as
adjunct clauses.}

\enumsentence{[Destroyed by the fire], the building still stood.}
\enumsentence{The fire raged for days [destroying the building].}
\enumsentence{$\ast$[That destroyed by the fire], the building
still stood.}
%what about: if destroyed by fire, the building would have been rebuilt?

(a)&(b)
\end{tabular}
\caption{Sample Participial Adjuncts}
\label{destroyed}
\end{figure}

\item Infinitival adjuncts, including purpose clauses, are licensed both with and without the complementizer
{\it for}.
\enumsentence{Harriet bought a Mustang [to impress Eugene].}
\enumsentence{[To impress Harriet], Eugene dyed his hair.}
\enumsentence{Traffic stopped [for Harriet to cross the street].}
\end{itemize}

\section{Discourse Conjunction}

The CONJs auxiliary tree is used to handle `discourse' conjunction,
as in sentence (\ex{1}).  Only the coordinating conjunctions ({\it
and, or} and {\it but}) are allowed to adjoin to the roots of
matrix sentences. Discourse conjunction with {\it and} is shown in the
derived tree in Figure~\ref{seuss-sentence}.

\enumsentence{And Truffula trees are what everyone needs! \cite{seuss71}}

and the transitive family (Tnx0Vnx1) contains a pair for the ergative
trees. All of these trees are anchored by the main verb of the adjunct clause,
and adjoin either at S or VP to the matrix clause.  Subordinating conjunctions
adjoin to these sentential adjunct trees, as described in section
\ref{sub-conj} below.  If no conjunction adjoins, only certain modes are
licensed for the adjunct clause.  These are described immediately below.

As described in Chapter~\ref{scomps-section} on sentential complements and
complementizers, the features {\bf $<$mode$>$} and {\bf $<$assign-comp$>$} are
used to control the occurrence of complementizers with the various clause
types.  This same mechanism is used here to ensure the correct distribution of
`bare' (i.e. conjunction-less) adjunct clauses.  Three values of {\bf
$<$mode$>$} are licensed: {\bf inf} (infinitive), 
{\bf ger} (gerundive) and {\bf ppart} (past participal, licensed only
for passive adjuncts).\footnote{We considered allowing bare indicative
clauses, such as {\it He died that others may live}, but these were
considered too archaic to be worth the additional ambiguity they would
add to the grammar.} They interact with complementizers as follows:

\section{Clauses Conjoined with Subordinating Conjunctions}
\label{sub-conj}
Subordinating conjunctions anchor one of the four auxiliary trees shown in
Figure~\ref{conjs}.\footnote{There is some amount of overlap between
subordinating conjunctions and prepositions. Items which were already in the
grammar as prepositions were not added as subordinating conjunctions where this
would have resulted in duplicate analyses.} The tree in Figure~\ref{conjs}(a)
is selected by a great majority of subordinating conjunctions.
Figure~\ref{conjs}(b) is anchored by multi-word conjunctions.\footnote{UCONJ
means `unanalyzed' conjunction, i.e. both words are not conjunctions
themselves, but together they form a complex subordinating conjunction.}  The
list of multi-word conjunctions was extracted from \cite{quirk85}, and includes
{\it as if}, {\it in order}, and {\it for all (that)}. The remaining two trees,
seen in Figures~\ref{conjs}(c) and \ref{conjs}(d), handle the three word
conjunctions in (\ex{1}) and (\ex{2}) respectively. Thus, the former has two
Conj anchors and an adverb substitution node, while the latter has three
anchors.  This multi-anchor treatment is very similar to that proposed for
idioms in \cite{AS89}, and the analysis of light verbs in the XTAG grammar (see
section~\ref{nx0lVN1-family}).

\end{figure}


Each of these trees adjoins at the interior S$_r$ node of the S and VP
sentential adjunct trees described above and shown in Figure \ref{hunt-trans}.
Subordinating conjunctions are grouped into classes, based on the type of
clause to which they may adjoin and whether they allow a complementizer to also
adjoin to the clause.  Each class instantiates a value for the {\bf
$<$sub-conj$>$} feature at the root S, which prevents subordinating
conjunctions from stacking.  They also instantiate values of the {\bf
$<$mode$>$} and {\bf $<$comp$>$} features of the foot S.  The {\bf $<$mode$>$}
value constrains the types of clauses the subordinating conjunction may adjoin
to and the {\bf $<$comp$>$} value constrains the complementizers which may
adjoin below it.  These classes are:

\begin{itemize}
\item IND1: Indicative clause with optional {\it that} complementizer,
e.g. {\it in order}, {\it so}.
\begin{itemize}
\enumsentence{He died so (that) others could live.} %tested
% weird: given
\end{itemize}

\item IND2: Indicative clause, no complementizer possible, e.g. {\it
in case}, {\it because}.
\begin{itemize}
\enumsentence{Because Bill ate their lettuce the rabbits are sad.} %tested
\enumsentence{$\ast$Because that Bill ate their lettuce the rabbits are sad.} %tested
\end{itemize}

%Currently removed from grammar because it was creating too many
%spurious parses, and we really need semantics to take advantage of
%this subtlety
%\item IND3: Asymmetric versions of coordinating conjuncts {\it and}
%and {\it but}; indicative clause, no complementizer possible, only
%allowed in sentence-final clausal adjunct trees.
%\begin{itemize}
%\enumsentence{Paddington opened the closet and his galoshes were inside.} %tested
%\enumsentence{$\ast$And his galoshes were inside Paddington opened the closet.}  %tested
%\end{itemize}

\item INF1: Infinitival clause, no complementizer; only {\it so as}, {\it
as if} and {\it as though}.
\begin{itemize}
\enumsentence{As if he had planned it, the door suddenly opened.} %tested
\enumsentence{$\ast$As if for Bill he had planned it, the door suddenly opened.} %tested
\end{itemize}

\item INF2: Infinitival clause optional {\it for} complementizer; only {\it
in order}.
\begin{itemize}
\enumsentence{Max picked the lettuce in order to eat it.}%tested
\enumsentence{Max picked the lettuce in order for us to eat it.}%tested
\end{itemize}

\item GER: Participial ({\bf $<$mode$>$=ger} or {\bf ppart}) complement, no
complementizer possible, e.g. {\it although}, {\it even if}, {\it
when}. 
\begin{itemize}
\enumsentence{Drawn recently, the pictures are valuable.}%tested
\enumsentence{Max ate spinach, impressing Mary.}%tested
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

The CONJs auxiliary tree is also used to do `discourse' conjunction,
as in sentence (\ex{1}).  Only the coordinating conjunctions (class
{\bf $<$sub-conj$>$=ind3}) are allowed to adjoin to the roots of
a171 7
The equation {\bf $<$sub-conj$>$=ind3} is checked as a root feature by
the parser (just as the root {\bf $<$mode$>$} must be indicative or
imperative).  This means that sentences with {\it and} or {\it but} at
the root are allowed as full sentences, while clauses with any other
conjunction at the root will be rejected. If the parser is set to
accept fragments (i.e. the top node is ``unconstrained''), it will
allow sentences with any conjunction at the root.

(\ref{hunts}(a)), while sentence-final adjuncts adjoin at a VP node
(\ref{hunts}(b)). In this, the XTAG analysis follows the findings on

Tree families with direct objects also contain a pair of passive
trees, and the transitive family (Tnx0Vnx1) also contains a pair of
ergative trees. All of these trees are anchored by the main verb of
the adjunct clause, and adjoin either at S or VP to the matrix clause.
Subordinating conjunctions adjoin to these sentential adjunct trees, as
described in section \ref{sub-conj} below.  If no conjunction adjoins,
only certain {\bf mode}s are licensed for the adjunct clause.  These
are described immediately below.

complementizers, the features {\bf mode} and {\bf assign-comp} are used to
control the occurrence of complementizers with the various clause
types.  This same mechanism is used here to ensure the correct
distribution of ``bare'' (i.e. conjunction-less) adjunct clauses.
Three {\bf modes} are licensed: {\bf ind}, {\bf inf}, and {\bf ger}. They
interact with complementizers as follows:

~~
Subordinating~~conjunctions~~anchor~~one~~of~~four~~~auxiliary~~trees:~~~ 
$\beta$CONJARBCONJs,\\$\beta$CONJarbCONJs, $\beta$UCONJUCONJs or
$\beta$CONJs.\footnote{There is some amount of overlap between
subordinating conjunctions and prepositions. Items which were already
in the grammar as prepositions were not added as subordinating
conjunctions where this would have resulted in duplicate analyses.} The
last of these, shown as Tree \ref{conjs}(a), is selected by a great
majority of subordinating conjunctions. $\beta$UCONJUCONJs, Tree
\ref{conjs}(b), is anchored by multi-word conjunctions; ``Uconj'' means
`unanalyzed' conjunction, i.e. both words are not conjunctions
themselves, but together they form a complex subordinating
conjunction.  The list of multi-word conjunctions was extracted from
\cite{quirk85}, and includes, e.g. {\it as if}, {\it in order}, {\it
for all (that)}. The remaining two trees, \ref{conjs}(c) and (d),
handle the three word conjunctions {\it as recently/quickly/etc. as} +
indicative complement and {\it as soon as} + participial
complement respectively. Thus, the former has two Conj anchors and an adverb
substitution node, while the latter has three anchors.  This
multi-anchor treatment is very similar to that proposed for idioms in
\cite{AS89}, and the analysis of light verbs in the XTAG grammar (see
Chapter \ref{nx0lVN1-family}).

sentential  adjunct trees described above and shown in Figure \ref{hunts}.
Subordinating conjunctions are grouped into classes, based on the type
of clause to which they may adjoin and whether they allow a
complementizer to also adjoin to the clause.  Each class instantiates
a value for the {\bf sub-conj} feature at the root S, which prevents
subordinating conjunctions from stacking.  They also instantiate
values of the {\bf mode} and {\bf comp} features of the foot S.  The
{\bf mode} value constrains the types of clauses the subordinating
conjunction may adjoin to and the {\bf comp} value constrains the
complementizers which may adjoin below it.  These classes are:
d163 3
d170 1
a170 1
\item GER: Participial ({\bf mode=ger} or {\bf ppart}) complement, no
d175 4
a178 3
These auxiliary trees are also used to do ``discourse'' coordination; all
subordinating conjunctions which can conjoin indicative clauses may also
adjoin to root matrix sentences.
