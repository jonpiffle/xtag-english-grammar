@\chapter{Where to Find What}
\label{table-intro}

The two tables that follow give an overview of what types of trees occur in
various tree families, with pointers to discussion in this report.  The
first table gives the expansion of abbreviations in the headers of the
second table. The abbeviations and their expansions can be matched in the
second table in the order in which they appear - first for the column
headers (left-right) and second for the row header (top-down). Notice that
the non-abbreviated headers will not be seen in this table, so they should
be skipped when following the order of appearance. The second table
contains two kinds of information related to the XTAG grammar. Firstly, the
column headers give the list all the tree families in the grammar (along
with the XTAG names for them). These can be also be referenced in the more
detailed decsriptions of each tree family in
Chapter~\ref{verb-classes}. Secondly, each column, corresponding to a tree
family, contains a list of the constructions available for that tree family
so that the row headers gives the constructions available in the grammar
across the tree families. An entry in a cell of the table indicates that
the tree(s) for the construction named in the row header are included in
the tree family named in the column header. Entries are of two types.  If
the particular tree(s) are displayed and/or discussed in this report the
entry gives a page number reference to the relevant discussion or
figure.\footnote{Since Chapter~\ref{verb-classes} has a brief discussion
and a declarative tree for every tree family, page references are given
only for other sections in which discussion or tree diagrams appear.}
Otherwise, a \xtagcheck \space indicates inclusion in the tree family but
no figure or discussion related specifically to that tree in this report.
Blank cells indicate that there are no trees for the construction named in
the row header in the tree family named in the column header.

%The second table gives the name given to each tree family in the actual
%XTAG grammar. This makes it easier to find the description of each tree
%family in Chapter~\ref{verb-classes} and to compare the description with
%the online XTAG grammar.

The two page table that follows gives an overview of what types of trees occur
in various tree families with pointers to discussion in this report.  An
entry in a cell of the table indicates that the tree(s) for the construction
named in the row header are included in the tree family named in the column
header. Entries are of two types.  If the particular tree(s) are displayed
and/or discussed in this report the entry gives a page number reference to the
relevant discussion or figure.\footnote{Since Chapter~\ref{verb-classes} has a
brief discussion and a declarative tree for every tree family, page references
are given only for other sections in which discussion or tree diagrams appear.}
Otherwise, a \xtagcheck \space indicates inclusion in the tree family but no
figure or discussion related specifically to that tree in this report.  Blank
cells indicate that there are no trees for the construction named in the row
header in the tree family named in the column header.  The table below gives
the expansion of abbreviations in the table headers.
