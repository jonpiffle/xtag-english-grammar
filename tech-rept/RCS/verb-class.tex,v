\chapter{Verb Classes}
\label{verb-classes}

Each main\footnote{Auxiliary verbs are handled under a different
mechanism.  See Chapter~\ref{auxiliaries} for details.} verb in the
syntactic lexicon selects at least one tree family\footnote{See
section \ref{tree-db} for explanation of tree families.}
(subcategorization frame).  Since the tree database and syntactic
lexicon are already separated for space efficiency (see
Chapter~\ref{overview}), each verb can efficiently select a large
number of trees by specifying a tree family, as opposed to each of the
individual trees.  This approach allows for a considerable reduction
in the number of trees that must be specified for any given verb or
form of a verb.

There are currently 57 tree families in the system.\footnote{An
  explanation of the naming convention used in naming the trees and
  tree families is available in Appendix~\ref{tree-naming}.}  This
chapter gives a brief description of each tree family and shows the
corresponding declarative tree\footnote{Before lexicalization, the
  $\diamond$ indicates the anchor of the tree.}, along with any
peculiar characteristics or trees.  It also indicates which
transformations are in each tree family, and gives the number of verbs
that select that family.\footnote{Numbers given are as of December 2000
  and are subject to some change with further development of the
  grammar.} A few sample verbs are given, along with example
sentences.


\section{Intransitive: Tnx0V}\index{verbs, intransitive}
\label{nx0V-family}

\begin{description}
  
\item[Description:] This tree family is selected by verbs that do not
  require an object complement of any type.  Adverbs, prepositional
  phrases and other adjuncts may adjoin on, but are not required for
  the sentences to be grammatical.  1,941 verbs select this family.

\item[Examples:]  {\it eat}, {\it sleep}, {\it dance} \\
{\it Al ate .} \\ 
{\it Seth slept .} \\ 
{\it Hyun danced .}

\item[Declarative tree:]  See Figure~\ref{nx0V-tree}.

\end{figure}

\item[Other available trees:] wh-moved subject, 
subject relative clause with overt and covert extracted {\it wh}-NP, 
adjunct (gap-less) relative clause with covert extracted {\it wh}-NP,
adjunct (gap-less) relative clause with PP pied-piping,
imperative, 
determiner gerund, 
NP gerund, 
pre-nominal participial modifier, 
PRO subject, 
NP gerund with PRO subject.

\end{description}


\section{Ergative: TEnx1V}\index{verbs,ergative}
\label{Enx1V-family}

\begin{description}
  
\item[Description:] This tree family is selected by verbs for which
  the syntactic subject corresponds to the logical object, which is
  indicated by the index of `1' on the subject NP.  See
  Chapter~\ref{ergatives} for more information about the ergative
  alternation.  292 verbs select the ergative tree family.

\item[Examples:] {\it sink}, {\it melt}\\
{\it The ship sank .} \\ 
{\it The ice melted .} \\ 

\item[Declarative tree:] See Figure~\ref{Enx1V-tree}.

\begin{figure}[htb]

\label{Enx1V-tree}
\end{figure}

\item[Other available trees:] wh-moved subject, subject relative clause
with overt and covert extracted {\it wh}-NP's, adjunct (gap-less) relative
clause with covert extracted {\it wh}-NP, adjunct (gap-less) relative clause with PP pied-piping,
NP gerund, determiner gerund, imperative, PRO subject, NP gerund with PRO
subject, prenominal participial modifier.

\end{description}


\section{Transitive: Tnx0Vnx1}\index{verbs,transitive}
\label{nx0Vnx1-family}

\begin{description}
  
\item[Description:] This tree family is selected by verbs that require
  only an NP object complement.  The NP's may be complex structures,
  including gerund NP's and NP's that take sentential complements.
  This does not include light verb constructions (see
  sections~\ref{nx0lVN1-family} and \ref{nx0lVN1Pnx2-family}).  4,506
  verbs select the transitive tree family.

\item[Examples:] {\it eat}, {\it dance}, {\it take}, {\it like}\\
{\it Al ate an apple .} \\ 
{\it Seth danced the tango .} \\ 
{\it Hyun is taking an algorithms course .} \\
{\it Anoop likes the fact that the semester is finished .}

\item[Declarative tree:] See Figure~\ref{nx0Vnx1-tree}.

\section{Ditransitive: Tnx0Vnx2nx1}\index{verbs,ditransitive}
\label{nx0Vnx2nx1-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:]  This tree family is selected by verbs that take exactly 
two NP complements.  The apparent ditransitive alternates involving
verbs in this class and benefactive PP's (e.g. {\it John baked a cake
for Mary}) are analyzed as transitives (see
section~\ref{nx0Vnx1-family}) with a PP adjunct. Benefactives are
taken to be adjunct PP's because they are optional (e.g. {\it John
baked a cake} vs. {\it John baked a cake for Mary}).  167 verbs select
the ditransitive tree family.

\item[Examples:] {\it ask}, {\it cook}, {\it win} \\
{\it Christy asked Mike a question .} \\ 
{\it Doug cooked his father dinner .} \\
{\it Dania won her sister a stuffed animal .}

\item[Declarative tree:]  See Figure~\ref{nx0Vnx2nx1-tree}.

\section{Ditransitive with PP: Tnx0Vnx1pnx2}\index{verbs, NP with VP verbs}
\label{nx0Vnx1pnx2-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:]  This tree family is selected by ditransitive verbs that
take a noun phrase followed by a prepositional phrase.  The
preposition is not constrained in the syntactic lexicon.  The
preposition must be required and not optional - that is, the sentence
must be ungrammatical with just the noun phrase (e.g. {\it $\ast$John
put the table}).  No verbs, therefore, should select both this tree
family and the transitive tree family (see
section~\ref{nx0Vnx1-family}).  There are 62 verbs that select this
tree family.

\item[Examples:] {\it ensconce}, {\it put}, {\it usher} \\
{\it Mary ensconced herself on the sofa .}   \\
{\it He put the book on the table .}  \\
{\it He ushered the patrons into the theater .}

\item[Declarative tree:]  See Figure~\ref{nx0Vnx1pnx2-tree}.

\label{nx0Vnx1Pnx2-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:]  This tree family is selected by ditransitive verbs that
take a noun phrase followed by a prepositional phrase headed by a
particular preposition.  The preposition is constrained by making it
one of the anchors.  There are 84 verbs that select this tree family.

\item[Examples:] {\it gear for}, {\it give to}, {\it remind of} \\
{\it The attorney geared his client for the trial .}

% 
% \item[Description:]  This tree family is selected by ditransitive verbs that
% undergo a shift to a {\it to} prepositional phrase.  These ditransitive verbs
% are clearly constrained so that when they shift, the prepositional phrase must
% start with {\it to}.  This is in contrast to the Ditransitives with PP in

\section{Sentential Complement with NP: Tnx0Vnx1s2}\index{verbs,Sentential
Complement with NP} 
\label{nx0Vnx1s2-family}

\begin{description}
  
\item[Description:] This tree family is selected by verbs that take both an
NP and a sentential complement.  The sentential complement may be
infinitive or indicative.  The type of clause is specified by each
individual verb in its syntactic lexicon entry.  A given verb may select
more than one type of sentential complement.  The declarative tree, and
many other trees in this family, are auxiliary trees, as opposed to the
more common initial trees.  These auxiliary trees adjoin onto an S node in
an existing tree of the type specified by the sentential complement.  This
is the mechanism by which TAGs are able to maintain long-distance
dependencies (see Chapter~\ref{extraction}), even over multiple embeddings
(e.g. {\it What did Bill tell Mary that John said?}).  83 verbs select this
tree family.

\item[Examples:] {\it beg}, {\it expect}, {\it tell} \\
{\it Srini begged Mark to increase his disk quota .} \\
{\it Beth told Jim that it was his turn .}

\section{Intransitive Verb Particle: Tnx0Vpl}\index{verbs,verb-particle,intransitive}
\label{nx0Vpl}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:] The trees in this tree family are anchored by both the
verb and the verb particle.  Both appear in the syntactic lexicon and
together select this tree family.  Intransitive verb particles can be
difficult to distinguish from intransitive verbs with adverbs adjoined
on. The main diagnostics for including verbs in this class are whether the
meaning is compositional or not, and whether there is a transitive version
of the verb/verb particle combination with the same or similar meaning.
The existence of an alternate compositional meaning is a strong indication
for a separate verb particle construction.  There are 159 verb/verb
particle combinations.

\item[Examples:] {\it add up}, {\it come out}, {\it sign off} \\
{\it The numbers never quite added up .} \\
{\it John finally came out (of the closet) .} \\
{\it I think that I will sign off now .}

\section{Transitive Verb Particle: Tnx0Vplnx1}\index{verbs,particle,transitive}
\label{nx0Vplnx1-family}

\begin{description}
  
\item[Description:] Verb/verb particle combinations that take an NP
complement select this tree family.  Both the verb and the verb particle
are anchors of the trees. Particle movement has been taken as the
diagnostic to distinguish verb particle constructions from intransitives
with adjoined PP's.  If the alleged particle is able to undergo particle
movement, in other words appear both before and after the direct object,
then it is judged to be a particle.  Items that do not undergo particle
movement are taken to be prepositions.  In many, but not all, of the verb
particle cases, there is also an alternate prepositional meaning in which
the lexical item did not move.  (e.g. {\it He looked up the number (in the
phonebook).  He looked the number up. Srini looked up the road (for
Purnima's car).  $\ast$He looked the road up.})  There are 548 verb/verb
particle combinations.

\item[Examples:] {\it blow off}, {\it make up}, {\it pick out} \\
{\it He blew off his linguistics class for the third time .} \\
{\it He blew his linguistics class off for the third time .} \\
{\it The dyslexic leprechaun made up the syntactic lexicon .} \\

family take 2 NP complements.  Both the verb and the verb particle anchor
the trees, and the verb particle can occur before, between, or after the

\section{Intransitive with PP: Tnx0Vpnx1}\index{verbs,intransitive with PP}
\label{nx0Vpnx1-family}
\begin{description}

\item[Description:]  The verbs that select this tree family are not strictly 
intransitive, in that they {\bf must} be followed by a prepositional
phrase.  Verbs that are intransitive and simply {\bf can} be followed
by a prepositional phrase do not select this family, but instead have
the PP adjoin onto the intransitive sentence.  Accordingly, there
should be no verbs in both this class and the intransitive tree family
(see section~\ref{nx0V-family}).  The prepositional phrase is not
restricted to being headed by any particular lexical item.  The PP is
expanded to facilitate extraction of the PP-internal NP.  Note that
these are not transitive verb particles (see
section~\ref{nx0Vplnx1-family}), since the head of the PP does not
move.  22 verbs select this tree family.

\item[Examples:] {\it grab}, {\it venture} {\it slog} \\
{\it Seth grabbed for the brass ring.} \\
{\it Jones ventured into the cave.}\\
{\it The soldiers slogged grudgingly through the mud.}

\section{Multiple anchor PP complement: Tnx0VPnx1}\label{verbs,prepositional complement} 
\label{nx0VPnx1-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:] This tree family is selected by multiple anchor
verb/preposition pairs which together have a non-compositional
interpretation.  For example, {\it think of} has the non-compositional
interpretation involving the inception of a notion or mental entity in
addition to the interpretation in which the agent is thinking about
someone or something.  To allow adverbs to appear between the verb and
the preposition, the trees contain an extra VP level.  206
verb/preposition pairs select this tree family.

\item[Examples:] {\it think of}, {\it believe in}, {\it depend on} \\
{\it Calvin thought of a new idea .}\\
{\it Hobbes believes in sleeping all day .}\\
{\it Bill depends on drinking coffee for stimulation .}\\

\section{Sentential Complement: Tnx0Vs1}\label{verbs,sentential complement}
\label{nx0Vs1-family}

\begin{description}
  
\item[Description:] This tree family is selected by verbs that take just a
sentential complement.  The sentential complement may be of type
infinitive, indicative, or small clause (see Chapter~\ref{small-clauses}).
The type of clause is specified by each individual verb in its syntactic
lexicon entry, and a given verb may select more than one type of sentential
complement.  The declarative tree, and many other trees in this family, are
auxiliary trees, as opposed to the more common initial trees.  These
auxiliary trees adjoin onto an S node in an existing tree of the type
specified by the sentential complement.  This is the mechanism by which
TAGs are able to maintain long-distance dependencies (see
Chapter~\ref{extraction}), even over multiple embeddings (e.g. {\it What
did Bill think that John said?}). 353 verbs select this tree family.

\item[Examples:]  {\it consider}, {\it think} \\
{\it Dania considered the algorithm unworkable .}\\
{\it Srini thought that the program was working .} \\

\section{Intransitive with Adjective: Tnx0Vax1}\index{verbs,intransitive with adjective}
\label{nx0Vax1-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:] The verbs that select this tree family take an
adjective as a complement.  The adjective may be regular, comparative, or
superlative.  It may also be formed from the special class of adjectives
derived from the transitive verbs (e.g. {\it agitated, broken}).  See
section~\ref{nx0Vnx1-family}).  Unlike the Intransitive with PP verbs (see
section~\ref{nx0Vpnx1-family}), some of these verbs may also occur as bare
intransitives as well.  This distinction is drawn because adjectives do not
normally adjoin onto sentences, as prepositional phrases do.  Other
intransitive verbs can only occur with the adjective, and these select only
this family.  The verb class is also distinguished from the adjective small
clauses (see section~\ref{nx0Ax1-family}) because these verbs are not
raising verbs.  34 verbs select this tree family.

\item[Examples:] {\it become}, {\it grow}, {\it smell} \\
{\it The greenhouse became hotter .} \\
{\it The plants grew tall and strong .} \\
{\it The flowers smelled wonderful .}

\label{s0Vnx1-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:] The verbs that select this tree family all take
sentential subjects, and are often referred to as `psych' verbs, since they
all refer to some psychological state of mind.  The sentential subject can
be indicative (complementizer required) or infinitive (complementizer
optional).  98 verbs that select this tree family.

\item[Examples:] {\it delight}, {\it impress}, {\it surprise} \\
{\it that the tea had rosehips in it delighted Christy .} \\

\section{Light Verbs: Tnx0lVN1}\index{verbs, light}
\label{nx0lVN1-family}

\begin{description}
  
\item[Description:] The verb/noun pairs that select this tree families are
pairs in which the interpretation is non-compositional and the noun
contributes argument structure to the predicate (e.g. {\it The man took a
walk.} vs. {\it The man took a radio}).  The verb and the noun occur
together in the syntactic database, and both anchor the trees.  The verbs
in the light verb constructions are {\it do}, {\it give}, {\it have}, {\it
make} and {\it take}.  The noun following the light verb is (usually) in a
bare infinitive form ({\it have a good cry}) and usually occurs with {\it
a(n)}.  However, we include deverbal nominals ({\it take a bath}, {\it give
a demonstration}) as well.  Constructions with nouns that do not contribute
an argument structure ({\it have a cigarette}, {\it give} NP {\it a black
eye}) are excluded.  In addition to semantic considerations of light verbs,
they differ syntactically from Transitive verbs
(section~\ref{nx0Vnx1-family}) as well in that the noun in the light verb
construction does not extract.  Some of the verb-noun anchors for this
family, like {\it take aim} and {\it take hold} disallow determiners, while
others require particular determiners.  For example, {\it have think} must
be indefinite and singular, as attested by the ungrammaticality of *{\it
John had the think/some thinks}.  Another anchor, {\it take leave} can
occur either bare or with a possesive pronoun (e.g., {\it John took his
leave}, but not *{\it John took the leave}).  This is accomplished through
feature specification on the lexical entries.  There are 242 verb/noun
pairs that select the light verb tree.

\item[Examples:] {\it give groan}, {\it have discussion}, {\it make comment} \\
{\it The audience gave a collective groan .} \\
{\it We had a big discussion about closing the libraries .} \\

\section{Ditransitive Light Verbs with PP Shift: Tnx0lVN1Pnx2}\index{verbs,ditransitive light verbs with PP shift}
\label{nx0lVN1Pnx2-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:] The verb/noun pairs that select this tree family are
pairs in which the interpretation is non-compositional and the noun
contributes argument structure to the predicate (e.g. {\it Dania made Srini
a cake.} vs.  {\it Dania made Srini a loan}).  The verb and the noun occur
together in the syntactic database, and both anchor the trees.  The verbs
in these light verb constructions are {\it give} and {\it make}.  The noun
following the light verb is (usually) a bare infinitive form (e.g. {\it
make a promise to Anoop}).  However, we include deverbal nominals
(e.g. {\it make a payment to Anoop}) as well.  Constructions with nouns
that do not contribute an argument structure are excluded.  In addition to
semantic considerations of light verbs, they differ syntactically from the
Ditransitive with PP Shift verbs (see section~\ref{nx0Vnx1Pnx2-family}) as
well in that the noun in the light verb construction does not extract.
Also, passivization is severely restricted.  Special determiner requirments
and restrictions are handled in the same manner as for the Tnx0lVN1 family.
There are 18 verb/noun pairs that select this family.

\item[Examples:] {\it give look}, {\it give wave}, {\it make promise} \\
{\it Dania gave Carl a murderous look .} \\
{\it Amanda gave us a little wave as she left .} \\
{\it Dania made Doug a promise .}

\section{Locative Small Clause with Ad anchor: Tnx0nx1ARB}
\label{nx0nx1ARB-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:] These trees are not anchored by verbs, but by adverbs
that are part of locative adverbial phrases. Locatives are explained in
much greater detail in the section on the locative modifier trees (see
section~\ref{locatives}). The only remarkable aspect of this tree family is
the wh-moved locative tree, $\alpha$W1nx0nx1ARB, shown in
Figure~\ref{W1nx0nx1ARB-tree}. This is the only tree family with this type
of transformation, in which the entire adverbial phrase is wh-moved but not
all elements are replaced by wh items (as in {\it how many city blocks away
is the record store?}). Locatives that consist of just the locative adverb
or the locative adverb and a degree adverb (see Section \ref{locatives} for
details) are treated as exhaustive PPs and therefore select that tree
family (Section~\ref{nx0Px1-family}) when used predicatively. For an
extensive description of small clauses, see
Section~\ref{sm-clause-xtag-analysis}. 26 adverbs select this tree family.

\item[Examples:] {\it ahead}, {\it offshore}, {\it behind} \\
{\it the crash is three blocks ahead} \\
{\it the naval battle was many kilometers offshore} \\
{\it how many blocks behind was Max?} \\

\section{Exceptional Case Marking: TXnx0Vs1}\index{verbs,ecm}
\label{Xnx0Vs1-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:] This tree family is selected by verbs that are
classified as exceptional case marking, meaning that the verb asssigns
accusative case to the subject of the sentential complement.  This is in
contrast to verbs in the Tnx0Vnx1s2 family
(section~\ref{nx0Vnx1s2-family}), which assign accusative case to a NP
which is not part of the sentential complement.  ECM verbs take sentential
complements which are either an infinitive or a ``bare'' infinitive.  As
with the Tnx0Vs1 family (section~\ref{nx0Vs1-family}), the declarative and
other trees in the Xnx0Vs1 family are auxiliary trees, as opposed to the
more common initial trees.  These auxiliary trees adjoin onto an S node in
an existing tree of the type specified by the sentential complement.  This
is the mechanism by which TAGs are able to maintain long-distance
dependencies (see Chapter~\ref{extraction}), even over multiple embeddings
(e.g. {\it Who did Bill expect to eat beans?}) or {\it who did Bill expect
Mary to like?}  See section~\ref{ecm-verbs} for details on this family.  21
verbs select this tree family.

\item[Examples:]  {\it expect}, {\it see} \\
{\it Van expects Bob to talk .}
{\it Bob sees the harmonica fall .}

\item[Declarative tree:]  See Figure~\ref{Xnx0Vs1-tree}.

\section{Idiom with V, D, and N anchors: Tnx0VDN1}\index{verbs,idiomatic}
\label{nx0VDN1-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:] This tree family is selected by idiomatic phrases in
which the verb, determiner, and NP are all frozen (as in {\it He kicked the
bucket.}).  Only a limited number of transformations are allowed, as
compared to the normal transitive tree family (see
section~\ref{nx0Vnx1-family}).  Other idioms that have the same structure
as {\it kick the bucket}, and that are limited to the same transformations
would select this tree, while different tree families are used to handle
other idioms.  Note that {\it John kicked the bucket} is actually
ambiguous, and would result in two parses - an idiomatic one (meaning that
John died), and a compositional transitive one (meaning that there is an
physical bucket that John hit with his foot). 21 idioms select this family.

\item[Examples:] {\it kick the bucket}, {\it bury the hatchet}, {\it
break the ice} \\
{\it Nixon kicked the bucket.}
{\it The opponents finally buried the hatchet.}
{\it The group activity really broke the ice.}

@1. changed names for relative clause trees. they used to say with and without comp which is hard to see in light of the new analysis. so the realtive clause trees are now called ... with overt and covert extracted wh-NP's
2. some of the sections sis not have tree names for PRO trees. added these
3. added sections for the 4 resultative families

\item[Description:] This tree family is selected by verbs that take
  both an NP and a sentential complement.  The sentential complement
  may be infinitive or indicative.  The type of clause is specified by
  each individual verb in its syntactic lexicon entry.  A given verb
  may select more than one type of sentential complement.  The
  declarative tree, and many other trees in this family, are auxiliary
  trees, as opposed to the more common initial trees.  These auxiliary
  trees adjoin onto an S node in an existing tree of the type
  specified by the sentential complement.  This is the mechanism by
  which TAGs are able to maintain long-distance dependencies (see
  Chapter~\ref{extraction}), even over multiple embeddings (e.g. {\it
    What did Bill tell Mary that John said?}).  79 verbs select this
  tree family.

select this tree family.  Intransitive verb particles can be difficult to
distinguish from intransitive verbs with adverbs adjoined on. The main
diagnostics for including verbs in this class are whether the meaning is
compositional or not, and whether there is a transitive version of the
verb/verb particle combination with the same or similar meaning.  The existence
of an alternate compositional meaning is a strong indication for a separate
verb particle construction.  There are 159 verb/verb particle combinations.

  complement select this tree family.  Both the verb and the verb
  particle are anchors of the trees. Particle movement has been taken
  as the diagnostic to distinguish verb particle constructions from
  intransitives with adjoined PP's.  If the alleged particle is able
  to undergo particle movement, in other words appear both before and
  after the direct object, then it is judged to be a particle.  Items
  that do not undergo particle movement are taken to be prepositions.
  In many, but not all, of the verb particle cases, there is also an
  alternate prepositional meaning in which the lexical item did not
  move.  (e.g. {\it He looked up the number (in the phonebook).  He
    looked the number up. Srini looked up the road (for Purnima's
    car).  $\ast$He looked the road up.})  There are 489 verb/verb

\item[Description:]  Verb/verb particle combinations that select this tree
family take 2 NP complements.  Both the verb and the verb particle anchor the
trees, and the verb particle can occur before, between, or after the noun
phrases.  Perhaps because of the complexity of the sentence, these verbs do not
seem to have passive alternations ({\it $\ast$A new bank account was opened up

this tree family.  The exhaustive list is given in the examples.

\item[Description:] This tree family is selected by verbs that take
  just a sentential complement.  The sentential complement may be of
  type infinitive, indicative, or small clause (see
  Chapter~\ref{small-clauses}).  The type of clause is specified by
  each individual verb in its syntactic lexicon entry, and a given
  verb may select more than one type of sentential complement.  The
  declarative tree, and many other trees in this family, are auxiliary
  trees, as opposed to the more common initial trees.  These auxiliary
  trees adjoin onto an S node in an existing tree of the type
  specified by the sentential complement.  This is the mechanism by
  which TAGs are able to maintain long-distance dependencies (see
  Chapter~\ref{extraction}), even over multiple embeddings (e.g. {\it
    What did Bill think that John said?}). 338 verbs select this tree
  family.

\item[Description:] The verb/noun pairs that select this tree families
  are pairs in which the interpretation is non-compositional and the
  noun contributes argument structure to the predicate (e.g. {\it The
    man took a walk.} vs. {\it The man took a radio}).  The verb and
  the noun occur together in the syntactic database, and both anchor
  the trees.  The verbs in the light verb constructions are {\it do},
  {\it give}, {\it have}, {\it make} and {\it take}.  The noun
  following the light verb is (usually) in a bare infinitive form
  ({\it have a good cry}) and usually occurs with {\it a(n)}.
  However, we include deverbal nominals ({\it take a bath}, {\it give
    a demonstration}) as well.  Constructions with nouns that do not
  contribute an argument structure ({\it have a cigarette}, {\it give}
  NP {\it a black eye}) are excluded.  In addition to semantic
  considerations of light verbs, they differ syntactically from
  Transitive verbs (section~\ref{nx0Vnx1-family}) as well in that the
  noun in the light verb construction does not extract.  Some of the
  verb-noun anchors for this family, like {\it take aim} and {\it take
    hold} disallow determiners, while others require particular
  determiners.  For example, {\it have think} must be indefinite and
  singular, as attested by the ungrammaticality of *{\it John had the
    think/some thinks}.  Another anchor, {\it take leave} can occur
  either bare or with a possesive pronoun (e.g., {\it John took his
    leave}, but not *{\it John took the leave}).  This is accomplished
  through feature specification on the lexical entries.  There are 259
  verb/noun pairs that select the light verb tree.

Srini a cake.} vs.  {\it Dania made Srini a loan}).  The verb and the
noun occur together in the syntactic database, and both anchor the
trees.  The verbs in these light verb constructions are {\it give} and
{\it make}.  The noun following the light verb is (usually) a bare
infinitive form (e.g. {\it make a promise to Anoop}).  However, we
include deverbal nominals (e.g. {\it make a payment to Anoop}) as
well.  Constructions with nouns that do not contribute an argument
structure are excluded.  In addition to semantic considerations of
light verbs, they differ syntactically from the Ditransitive with PP
Shift verbs (see section~\ref{nx0Vnx1Pnx2-family}) as well in that the
noun in the light verb construction does not extract.  Also,
passivization is severely restricted.  Special determiner requirments
and restrictions are handled in the same manner as for the Tnx0lVN1
family.  There are 18 verb/noun pairs that select this family.

\item{Description:} This tree family is selected by multi-word
  prepositions that take sentential subjects. In particular, this
  family is selected by three-word prepositions.  The first and third
  words are always prepositions, and the middle word is a noun.  The
  noun is marked for null adjunction since it cannot be modified by
  noun modifiers.  All three components of the multi-word preposition
  are anchors.  Small clauses are explained in much greater detail in
  section~\ref{sm-clause-xtag-analysis}.  9 prepositions select this
  tree family.

\item[Description:]  These trees are not anchored by verbs, but by adverbs 
that are part of locative adverbial phrases. Locatives are explained 
in much greater detail in the section on the locative modifier trees
(see section~\ref{locatives}). The only remarkable aspect of this tree 
family is the wh-moved locative tree, $\alpha$W1nx0nx1ARB, shown in 
Figure~\ref{W1nx0nx1ARB-tree}. This is the only tree family with this type of 
transformation, in which the entire adverbial phrase is wh-moved but not all 
elements are replaced by wh items (as in {\it how many city blocks away 
is the record store?}). Locatives that consist of just the locative adverb 
or the locative adverb and a degree adverb (see Section \ref{locatives} for 
details) are treated as exhaustive PPs and therefore select that tree 
family (Section~\ref{nx0Px1-family}) when used predicatively. For an 
extensive description of small clauses, see

\item[Other available trees:]  wh-moved subject, relative clause on subject

d2095 12
a2106 12
\item[Description:]  This tree family is selected by verbs that are classified
as exceptional case marking, meaning that the verb asssigns accusative case
to the subject of the sentential complement.  This is in contrast to verbs
in the Tnx0Vnx1s2 family (section~\ref{nx0Vnx1s2-family}), which assign 
accusative
case to a NP which is not part of the sentential complement.  ECM verbs
take sentential complements which are either an infinitive or a ``bare''
infinitive.  As with the Tnx0Vs1 family (section~\ref{nx0Vs1-family}), the
declarative and other trees in the Xnx0Vs1 family are auxiliary trees, as
opposed to the more common initial trees.  These auxiliary trees adjoin onto an
S node in an existing tree of the type specified by the sentential complement.
This is the mechanism by which TAGs are able to maintain long-distance

\item[Description:]  This tree family is selected by idiomatic phrases
in which the verb, determiner, and NP are all frozen (as in {\it He
kicked the bucket.}).  Only a limited number of transformations are
allowed, as compared to the normal transitive tree family (see
section~\ref{nx0Vnx1-family}).  Other idioms that have the same
structure as {\it kick the bucket}, and that are limited to the same
transformations would select this tree, while different tree families
are used to handle other idioms.  Note that {\it John kicked the
bucket} is actually ambiguous, and would result in two parses - an
idiomatic one (meaning that John died), and a compositional transitive
one (meaning that there is an physical bucket that John hit with
his foot). 21 idioms select this family.

\begin{description}

\item[Description:]  This tree family is selected by idiomatic phrases
in which the verb, determiner, and NP are all frozen (as in {\it He
kicked the bucket.}).  Only a limited number of transformations are
allowed, as compared to the normal transitive tree family (see
section~\ref{nx0Vnx1-family}).  Other idioms that have the same
structure as {\it kick the bucket}, and that are limited to the same
transformations would select this tree, while different tree families
are used to handle other idioms.  Note that {\it John kicked the
bucket} is actually ambiguous, and would result in two parses - an
idiomatic one (meaning that John died), and a compositional transitive
one (meaning that there is an physical bucket that John hit with
his foot). 1 idiom selects this family.

\item[Description:]  This tree family is selected by verbs that do not 
require an object complement of any type.  Adverbs, prepositional phrases and
other adjuncts may adjoin on, but are not required for the sentences to be
grammatical.  2,092 verbs select this family.

d72 7

\item[Description:] This tree family is selected by verbs that require only an 
NP object complement.  The NP's may be complex structures, including gerund
NP's and NP's that take sentential complements.  This does not include light
verb constructions (see sections~\ref{nx0lVN1-family} and
\ref{nx0lVN1Pnx2-family}).  4,378 verbs select the transitive tree family.

d444 15
a459 13
\item[Description:]  Verb/verb particle combinations that take an NP complement
select this tree family.  Both the verb and the verb particle are anchors of
the trees. Particle movement has been taken as the diagnostic to distinguish
verb particle constructions from intransitives with adjoined PP's.  If the
alleged particle is able to undergo particle movement, in other words appear
both before and after the direct object, then it is judged to be a particle.
Items that do not undergo particle movement are taken to be prepositions.  In
many, but not all, of the verb particle cases, there is also an alternate
prepositional meaning in which the lexical item did not move.  (e.g. {\it He
looked up the number (in the phonebook).  He looked the number up. Srini looked
up the road (for Purnima's car).  $\ast$He looked the road up.})  There are 488
verb/verb particle combinations.

    What did Bill think that John said?}). 339 verbs select this tree
d732 26
a758 26
\item[Description:] The verb/noun pairs that select this tree families are 
pairs in which the interpretation is non-compositional and the noun
contributes argument structure to the predicate (e.g. {\it The man
took a walk.} vs. {\it The man took a radio}).  The verb and the noun
occur together in the syntactic database, and both anchor the trees.
The verbs in the light verb constructions are {\it do}, {\it give},
{\it have}, {\it make} and {\it take}.  The noun following the light
verb is (usually) in a bare infinitive form ({\it have a good cry})
and usually occurs with {\it a(n)}.  However, we include deverbal
nominals ({\it take a bath}, {\it give a demonstration}) as well.
Constructions with nouns that do not contribute an argument structure
({\it have a cigarette}, {\it give} NP {\it a black eye}) are
excluded.  In addition to semantic considerations of light verbs, they
differ syntactically from Transitive verbs
(section~\ref{nx0Vnx1-family}) as well in that the noun in the light
verb construction does not extract.  Some of the verb-noun anchors for
this family, like {\it take aim} and {\it take hold} disallow
determiners, while others require particular determiners.  For
example, {\it have think} must be indefinite and singular, as attested
by the ungrammaticality of *{\it John had the think/some thinks}.
Another anchor, {\it take leave} can occur either bare or with a
possesive pronoun (e.g., {\it John took his leave}, but not *{\it John
took the leave}).  This is accomplished through feature specification
on the lexical entries.  There are 241 verb/noun pairs that select the
light verb tree.

as a multi-component anchor for the tree family.  This tree family is
used for it-clefts in which the clefted element is an PP and there are
no gaps in the clause which follows the PP.  The PP is interpreted as
an adjunct of the following clause. See Chapter~\ref{it-clefts} for
additional discussion.

or infinitive.  Note that these trees are anchored by adjectives, not
verbs.  Small clauses are explained in much greater detail in
section~\ref{sm-clause-xtag-analysis}.  This section is presented here

\item[Description:]  This tree family is selected by adjectives that take

Note that these trees are anchored by adjectives, not verbs.  Most
adjectives that take the Adjective Small Clause tree family (see
section~\ref{nx0Ax1-family}) take this family as well.\footnote{No great
attempt has been made to go through and decide which adjectives should actually
take this family and which should not.}  Small clauses are explained in much
greater detail in section~\ref{sm-clause-xtag-analysis}.  This section is

\item{Description:}  This tree family is selected by multi-word prepositions 
that take sentential subjects. In particular, this family is selected by
three-word prepositions.  The first and third words are always prepositions, 
and the middle word is a noun.  The noun is marked for null adjunction since 
it cannot be modified by noun modifiers.  All three components of the 
multi-word preposition are anchors.  Small clauses are explained in much 
greater detail in section~\ref{sm-clause-xtag-analysis}.  10 prepositions 
select this tree family.

Constructions with nouns that do not contribute an argument structure ({\it

to semantic considerations of light verbs, they differ syntactically from
Transitive verbs (section~\ref{nx0Vnx1-family}) as well in that the noun in the
light verb construction does not extract.  Because the noun is an anchor in the
tree, there are two different tree families representing nouns that require
determiners and those that occur without them (see
Chapter~\ref{det-comparitives}).  There are 95 verb/noun pairs that select the
light verb tree without determiners, and 241 that select the light verb tree
with determiners.

\item[Description:]  The verb/noun pairs that select these tree families are 
pairs in which the interpretation is non-compositional and the noun contributes
argument structure to the predicate (e.g. {\it Dania made Srini a cake.} vs.
{\it Dania made Srini a loan}).  The verb and the noun occur together in the
syntactic database, and both anchor the trees.  The verbs in these light verb
constructions are {\it give} and {\it make}.  The noun following the light verb
is (usually) a bare infinitive form (e.g. {\it make a promise to Anoop}).
However, we include deverbal nominals (e.g. {\it make a payment to Anoop}) as
well.  Constructions with nouns that do not contribute an argument structure
are excluded.  In addition to semantic considerations of light verbs, they
differ syntactically from the Ditransitive with PP Shift verbs (see
section~\ref{nx0Vnx1Pnx2-family}) as well in that the noun in the light verb
construction does not extract.  Also, passivization is severely restricted.
Because the noun is an anchor in the tree, there are two different tree
families representing nouns that require determiners and those that occur
without them (see Chapter~\ref{det-comparitives}).  There are 10 verb/noun
pairs that select the trees without determiners, and 18 that select the trees
with determiners.

\item[Description:]  This tree family is selected by verbs that take both an NP
and a sentential complement.  The sentential complement may be infinitive or
indicative.  The type of clause is specified by each individual verb in its
syntactic lexicon entry.  A given verb may select more than one type of
sentential complement.  The declarative tree, and many other trees in this
family, are auxiliary trees, as opposed to the more common initial trees.
These auxiliary trees adjoin onto an S node in an existing tree of the type
specified by the sentential complement.  This is the mechanism by which TAGs
are able to maintain long-distance dependencies (see Chapter~\ref{extraction}),
even over multiple embeddings (e.g. {\it What did Bill tell Mary that John
said?}).  91 verbs select this tree family.

\item[Description:]  This tree family is selected by verbs that take just a

indicative, or small clause (see Chapter~\ref{small-clauses}).  The type of
clause is specified by each individual verb in its syntactic lexicon entry, and
a given verb may select more than one type of sentential complement.  The
declarative tree, and many other trees in this family, are auxiliary trees, as
opposed to the more common initial trees.  These auxiliary trees adjoin onto an
S node in an existing tree of the type specified by the sentential complement.
This is the mechanism by which TAGs are able to maintain long-distance
dependencies (see Chapter~\ref{extraction}), even over multiple embeddings
(e.g. {\it What did Bill think that John said?}). 340 verbs select this tree

Each main\footnote{Auxiliary verbs are handled under a different mechanism.
See Chapter~\ref{auxiliaries} for details.} verb in the syntactic lexicon
selects at least one tree family\footnote{See section \ref{tree-db} for
explanation of tree families.} (subcategorization frame).  Since the tree
database and syntactic lexicon are already separated for space efficiency (see
Chapter~\ref{overview}), each verb can efficiently select a large number of
trees by specifying a tree family, as opposed to each of the individual trees.
This approach allows for a considerable reduction in the number of trees that
must be specified for any given verb or form of a verb.

\item[Description:]  This tree family is selected by idiomatic phrases in which
the verb, determiner, and NP are all frozen (as in {\it He kicked the
bucket.}).  Only a limited number of transformations are allowed, as compared
to the normal transitive tree family (see section~\ref{nx0Vnx1-family}).  The
analysis of idioms has not been done for idioms in general; this tree is
included to illustrate how they could be handled in XTAG.  Other idioms that
have the same structure as {\it kick the bucket}, and that are limited to the
same transformations would select this tree, while different tree families
would be needed to handle other idioms.  Note that {\it John kicked the bucket}
is actually ambiguous, and would result in two parses - an idiom (meaning that
John died), a simple transitive sentences (meaning that there is an physical
bucket that John hit with his foot). 1 verb selects the idiom family.

take a noun phrase followed by a prepositional phrase.  The preposition is not
constrained.  The preposition must be required and not optional - that is, the
sentence must be ungrammatical with just the noun phrase (e.g. {\it $\ast$John
put the table}).  No verbs, therefore, should select both this tree family and
the transitive tree family (see section~\ref{nx0Vnx1-family}).  This tree
family is also distinguished from the ditransitive verbs, such as {\it give},
that undergo verb shifting (see section~\ref{nx0Vnx1Pnx2-family}).  There are
62 verbs that select this tree family.

\item[Description:]  This tree family is selected by multi-word prepositions 
that take sentential subjects. In particular, this family is selected by
two-word prepositions, where the first word is a conjunction, the second word a
preposition.  Both components of the multi-word preposition are anchors. The 
sentential subject can be indicative or infinitive.  Small clauses are 
explained in much greater detail in section~\ref{sm-clause-xtag-analysis}.  
1 preposition selects this tree family.

\item[Examples:]  {\it because of} \\
{\it that Diane uses a different name now is because of her recent explosion 
onto the modern dance scene .} \\

\item[Declarative tree:]  See Figure~\ref{s0CONJPnx1-tree}.

See section~\ref{auxiliaries} for details.} verb in the syntactic
lexicon selects 
at least one tree family\footnote{A tree family is a collection of trees that
would be considered related under a transformational grammar approach.  See
section~\ref{verb-transformations} for more details.}, or subcategorization
frame.  Since the tree database and syntactic lexicon are already separated for
space efficiency (see \ref{overview}), each verb can efficiently select a
large number of trees by specifying a tree family, as opposed to each of the
individual trees.  This approach allows for a considerably reduction in the
number of trees that must be specified for any given verb or form of a verb.

any peculiar characteristics or trees.  It also tells which transformations are

ditransitive verb shift (see Section~\ref{nx0Vnx1Pnx2-family}).  Various
alternations that change a sentence in this class into a NP followed by a PP
are handled by the transitive version of the verb (see
Section~\ref{nx0Vnx1-family}) followed by a PP that adjoins on.  In these
cases, the PP is optional.  Currently, only one verb in our database ({\it
ensure}) selects the DiTransitive with PP tree family (see
Section~\ref{nx0Vnx1pnx2-family}).  In this case, the verb does not have a
transitive alternation, and so the prepositional phrase is required.
Approximately 54 verbs select the Di-Transitive tree family.

\item[Description:]  The tree family is selected by verbs that take both a NP
and sentential complement.  The sentential complement may be an infinitive,
indicative, or small clause (see Section~\ref{small-clauses}).  The type of
clause is specified by each individual verb in its syntactic lexicon entry.  A
given verb may select more than one type of sentential complement.  The
declarative tree, and many other trees in this family, are auxiliary trees, as
opposed to the more normal initial trees.  These auxiliary trees adjoin onto an
S node in an existing tree of the type specified by the sentential complement.
This is the mechanism by which TAGs are able to maintain long-distance
dependencies (see Section~\ref{long-distance-dependencies}), even over multiple
embeddings (ie. {\it What did Bill tell Mary that John said?}.  Approximately
106 verbs select this tree family.

the trees.  Distinguishing verb particles with an NP complement from
prepositional phrases can be somewhat controversial, but we fell back on a
purely syntactic test.  If the Prep/particle lexical item moved, then it was a
particle.  If it did not, then it was a preposition heading a prepositional
phrase.  In many, but not all, of the verb particle cases, there was an
alternate prepositional meaning in which the lexical item did not move.
(ie. {\it He looked up the number (in the phonebook).  He looked the number
up. He looked up the road (to see if any cars were coming).  *He looked the
road up.})  There are approximately 841 verb/verb particle combinations.

Unlike the Intransitive with PP verbs (see Section~\ref{nx0Vpnx1-family}), some
of these verbs may also occur as bare intransitives as well.  This distinction
is drawn because adjectives do not normally adjoin onto sentences, as
prepositional phrases do.  Other intransitive verbs can only occur with the
adjective, and these select only this family.  The verb class is also
distinguished from the adjective small clauses (see
