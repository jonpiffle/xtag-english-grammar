Definitions are given in small caps (\xtag-def).

Features should be in bold face (\bf), with angle brackets around the name of
the feature.

Lexical items should be italized (\it).

Figure and Table should be capitalized.  section, chapter, sentence, and
appendix should not.

Be careful to distinguish between the FB-LTAG formalmism vs the XTAG grammar.

Parts of speech should not be capitalized, but acronyms (e.g. NP, VP) are.

Be careful about the distinction between e.g. (for example) and i.e. (that is).

XTAG should always be entirely in caps.

Some spellings: co-index, foot node, root node, {\it by} phrase

To highlight lexical items in an enumsentence, use boldface (\bf).

Citations should either be part of the text or in parentheses.

References to \enumsentence should be in parentheses.

Figure numbers should not be in parentheses, but subfigures should (e.g Figure 40(b)).

No spaces when using a dash for a range (e.g. (4)-(6)).

Use $\ast$ for starring bad sentences.

All figures should have tree names (when appropriate) indicated in the caption
(this is for the list of figures at the beginning of the report).

All figures should be (at least) [hbt].

Plural of NP, VP, PP, etc should be NP's, VP's, PP's, etc.

There should be no spaces in the equation for feature structures
(e.g. <case>=acc).

Use the math mode only for the angle brackets in the feature structures.  Using
it for the =,+,- negates the \bf instruction (e.g. $<$const$>$=+).

No figures should be stranded by themselves at the end of a chapter.

No shortcites on references.
