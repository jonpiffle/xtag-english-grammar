\section{Case Assignment}
\label{case-assignment}
\subsection{Approaches to Case}
\subsubsection{Case in GB theory}

GB (Government and Binding) theory proposes the following
`case filter' as a requirement on S-structure.\footnote{There are certain
problems with applying the case filter as a requirement at the level of
S-structure.  These issues are not crucial to the discussion of the English
XTAG implementation of case and so will not be discussed here.  Interested
readers are referred to
\cite{lasnik-uriagereka88}.}

\begin{verse}
\xtagdef{Case Filter}
Every overt NP must be assigned abstract case. \cite{haegeman91}
\end{verse}

Abstract case is taken to be universal.  Languages with rich morphological case
marking, such as Latin, and languages with very limited morphological case
marking, like English, are all presumed to have full systems of abstract case
that differ only in the extent of morphological realization.

In GB, abstract case is assigned to NP's by various case assigners, namely
verbs, prepositions, and INFL.  Verbs and prepositions are said to assign
accusative case to NP's that they govern, and INFL assigns nominative case to
NP's that it governs.  These governing categories are constrained in where they
can assign case by means of `barriers' based on `minimality conditions',
although these are relaxed in `exceptional case marking' situations.  The
details of the GB analysis are beyond the scope of this technical report, but
see \cite{chomsky86} for the original analysis or \cite{haegeman91} for an
overview.  Let it suffice for us to say that the notion of abstract case and
the case filter are useful in accounting for a number of phenomena including
the distribution of nominative and accusative case, and the distribution of
overt NP's and empty categories (such as PRO).

\subsubsection{Minimalism and Case} 

A major conceptual difference between GB theories and Minimalism is that in
Minimalism, lexical items carry their features with them rather than being
assigned their features based on the nodes that they end up at.  For nouns,
this means that they carry case with them, and that their case is `checked'
when they are in SPEC position of AGR$_s$ or AGR$_o$, which subsequently
disappears (\cite{chomsky92}).

\subsection{Case in XTAG}

The English XTAG grammar adopts the notion of case and the case filter for many
of the same reasons argued in the GB literature.  However, in some respects the
English XTAG grammar's implementation of case more closely resembles the
treatment in Chomsky's Minimalism framework (\cite{chomsky92}) than the system
outlined in the GB literature (\cite{chomsky86}).  As in Minimalism, nouns in
the XTAG grammar carry case with them, which is eventually `checked'. However
in the XTAG grammar, noun cases are checked against the case values assigned
by the verb during the unification of the feature structures.  Unlike Chomsky's
Minimalism, there are no separate AGR nodes; the case checking comes from the
verbs directly. Case assignment from the verb is more like the GB approach than
the requirement of a SPEC-head relationship in Minimalism.

Most nouns in English do not have separate forms for nominative and accusative
case, and so they are ambiguous between the two.  Pronouns, of course, are
morphologically marked for case, and each carries the appropriate case in its
feature.  Figures~\ref{nouns-with-case}(a) and \ref{nouns-with-case}(b) show
the NP tree anchored by a noun and a pronoun, respectively, along with the
feature values associated with each word.  Note that {\it books} simply gets
the default case {\bf nom/acc}, while {\it she} restricts the case to be {\bf
nom}.

\subsection{Case Assigners}

\subsubsection{Prepositions}
\label{prep-case}

Case is assigned in the XTAG English grammar by two components - verbs and
prepositions.\footnote{{\it For} also assigns case as a complementizer.  See
section \ref{for-complementizer} for more details.}  Prepositions assign
accusative case ({\bf acc}) through their {\bf $<$assign-case$>$} feature,
which is linked directly to the {\bf $<$case$>$} feature of their objects.
Figure~\ref{PXPnx-with-case}(a) shows a lexicalized preposition tree, while
Figure~\ref{PXPnx-with-case}(b) shows the same tree with the NP tree from
Figure~\ref{nouns-with-case}(a) substituted into the NP position.
Figure~\ref{PXPnx-with-case}(c) is the tree in Figure~\ref{PXPnx-with-case}(b)
after unification has taken place.  Note that the case ambiguity of {\it books}
has been resolved to accusative case.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Verbs}
\label{case-for-verbs}
Verbs are the other part of speech in the XTAG grammar that can assign case.
Because XTAG does not distinguish INFL and VP nodes, verbs must provide case
assignment on the subject position in addition to the case assigned to their NP
complements.

Assigning case to NP complements is handled by building the case values of the
complements directly into the tree that the case assigner (the verb) anchors.
Figures~\ref{S-tree-with-case}(a) and \ref{S-tree-with-case}(b) show an S
tree\footnote{Features not pertaining to this discussion have been taken out to
improve readability and to make the trees easier to fit onto the page.} that
would be anchored\footnote{The diamond marker ($\diamond$) indicates the
anchor(s) of a structure if the tree has not yet been lexicalized.} by a
transitive and ditransitive verb, respectively.  Note that the case assignments
for the NP complements are already in the tree, even though there is not yet a
lexical item anchoring the tree.  Since every verb that selects these trees
(and other trees in each respective subcategorization frame) assigns the same
case to the complements, building case features into the tree has exactly the
same result as putting the case feature value in each verb's lexical entry.

\begin{figure}[htb]

\begin{tabular}{ccc}
{\psfig{figure=ps/case-files/alphanx0Vnx1-case-features.ps,height=2.0in}}

\end{tabular}\\
\caption {Case assignment to NP arguments}
\label{S-tree-with-case}
\label{2;1,1}
\label{2;1,3}
\end{figure}


The case assigned to the subject position varies with verb form.  Since the
XTAG grammar treats the inflected verb as a single unit rather than dividing it
into INFL and V nodes, case, along with tense and agreement, is expressed in
the features of verbs, and must be passed in the appropriate manner.  The trees
in Figure~\ref{lexicalized-S-tree-with-case} show the path of linkages that
joins the {\bf$<$assign-case$>$} feature of the V to the {\bf $<$case$>$}
feature of the subject NP.  The morphological form of the verb determines the
value of the {\bf $<$assign-case$>$} feature.
Figures~\ref{lexicalized-S-tree-with-case}(a) and
\ref{lexicalized-S-tree-with-case}(b) show the same tree\footnote{Again, the 
feature structures shown have been restricted to those that pertain to the V/NP
interaction.} anchored by different morphological forms of the verb {\it sing},
which give different values for the {\bf $<$assign-case$>$} feature.

\end{tabular}\\
\caption {Proper case assignment with auxiliary verbs}
\label{Vvx-with-case}
\end{figure}

The adjunction of an auxiliary verb onto the VP node breaks the {\bf
$<$assign-case$>$} link from the main V, replacing it with a link from the
auxiliary verb instead.\footnote{See section \ref{aux-non-inverted} for a more
complete explanation of how this relinking occurs.} The progressive form of the
verb in Figure~\ref{lexicalized-S-tree-with-case}(b) has the feature-value {\bf
$<$assign-case$>$=none}, but this is overridden by the adjunction of the
appropriate form of the auxiliary word {\it be}.  Figure~\ref{Vvx-with-case}(a)
shows the lexicalized auxiliary tree, while Figure~\ref{Vvx-with-case}(b) shows
it adjoined into the transitive tree shown in
Figure~\ref{lexicalized-S-tree-with-case}(b).  The case value passed to the
subject NP is now {\bf nom} (nominative).


\subsection{PRO in a unification based framework}

Most forms of a verb assign nominative case, although some forms, such as past
participle, assign no case whatsoever.  This is different than assigning case
{\bf none}, as the progressive form of the verb {\it sing} does in
Figure~\ref{lexicalized-S-tree-with-case}(b).  The distinction of a case {\bf
none} from no case is indicative of a divergence from the standard GB theory.
In GB theory, the absence of case on an NP means that only PRO can fill that
NP.  With feature unification as is used in the FB-LTAG grammar, the absence of
case on an NP means that {\em any\/} NP can fill it, regardless of its case.
This is due to the mechanism of unification, in which if something is
unspecified, it can unify with anything.  Thus we have a specific case {\bf
none} to handle verb forms that in GB theory do not assign case.  PRO is the
only NP with case {\bf none}.  Verb forms that assign no case, as the past
participle mentioned above, can do so because they cannot occur without an
auxiliary verb which takes care of the case assignment.  Note that although we
are drawn to this treatment by our use of unification for feature manipulation,
our treatment is very similar to the assignment of null case to PRO in
\cite{ChomskyLasnik93}.  \cite{watanabe93} also proposes a very similar 
approach within Chomsky's Minimalist framework.\footnote{See section \ref{PRO}
for additional discussion of PRO.}
