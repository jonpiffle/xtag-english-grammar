\section{Introduction}

% problem

An important characteristic of an
FB-LTAG is that it is lexicalized, i.e., each lexical item is anchored to a
tree structure that encodes subcategorization information.  Trees with the same
canonical subcategorizations are grouped into tree families.  The reuse of tree
substructures, such as wh-movement,
 in many different trees 
creates redundancy, which poses a problem for grammar development
and maintenance \cite{vijay-schabes92}.  To consistently implement a change in
some general aspect of the design of the grammar, all the relevant trees
currently must be inspected and edited.  Vijay Shanker and Schabes suggested
the use of hierarchical organization and of tree descriptions to specify
substructures that would be present in several elementary trees of a grammar.
Since then, in addition to ourselves, 
Becker, \cite{becker94}, Evans et al. \cite{Evans95}, and 
Candito\cite{Candito96} have
developed systems for organizing trees of a TAG which could be used for
developing and maintaining grammars.

 Our system is based
on the ideas expressed in Vijay-Shanker and Schabes, \cite{vijay-schabes92}, to
use partial-tree descriptions in specifying a grammar by separately defining
pieces of tree structures to encode independent syntactic principles. Various
individual specifications are then combined to form the elementary trees of the
grammar. The chapter begins with a description of 
our grammar development system, and its implementation. We will then
show the main results of using this tool to generate 
the Penn English grammar as well as a Chinese
TAG.  We describe the significant properties of both grammars, pointing out the
major differences between them, and the methods by which our system is informed
about these language-specific properties.  The chapter ends with the conclusion
and future work.




\section{System Overview}

In our approach,  
three types of components -- subcategorization frames, blocks and
lexical redistribution rules -- are used to describe lexical and
syntactic information.
%Lexical Redistribution Rule (LRR).
Actual trees are generated automatically from these abstract descriptions,
as shown in Figure \ref{system-overview}.
In maintaining the grammar only the abstract
descriptions need ever be manipulated; the tree descriptions and the
actual trees which they subsume are computed deterministically from these
high-level descriptions.

\subsection{Subcategorization frames}
Subcategorization frames specify
the category of the main anchor, 
the number of  arguments,
each argument's category and position with respect to the anchor,
and other information
such as feature equations or node expansions.
Each tree family has one canonical subcategorization frame.

\subsection{Blocks}

Blocks are used to represent the tree substructures that are reused
in different trees, i.e. blocks 
subsume classes of trees. Each block includes
a set of nodes, dominance relation, parent relation, 
precedence relation between nodes,
and feature equations. This follows the definition of the tree 
descriptions specified in a logical language patterned after Rogers and
Vijay-Shanker\cite{rogers-vijay94}. 

Blocks are divided into two types according to their functions: 
subcategorization  blocks
and transformation blocks. 
The former describes structural configurations incorporating
the various information in a subcategorization frame. 
For example, some of the subcategorization blocks
used in the
development of the English grammar are shown in Figure 
\ref{subcat-blocks}.\footnote{
In order to focus on the use of tree descriptions and to 
make the figures less cumbersome, we show only
the structural aspects and do not show the feature value specification.
The parent, (immediate dominance), relationship is illustrated by
a plain line and the dominance relationship by a dotted line.
The arc between nodes shows the precedence order of
the nodes are unspecified. The nodes' categories
are enclosed in parentheses.}

When the subcategorization frame for a  verb is given
 by the grammar
developer, the system will automatically create a new block (of code) by
essentially selecting the appropriate primitive subcategorization blocks
corresponding to the argument information specified in that verb
frame. 

The transformation blocks are used for various transformations such as
wh-movement. These transformation blocks do not encode
rules for modifying trees, but rather describe
 the properties of a particular syntactic construction.
 Figure \ref{trans-blocks} depicts
our representation of phrasal extraction.
This can be specialized to give the
blocks for wh-movement, topicalization, relative clause formation, etc.  
For example, the
wh-movement block is defined by further specifying that the ExtractionRoot is
labeled S, the NewSite
has a +wh feature, and so on.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centerline{\psfig{figure=ps/lexorg/extract.eps,height=2.5in,angle=0}}
\caption{Transformation blocks for extraction}
\label{trans-blocks}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Lexical Redistribution Rules (LRRs)}
The third type of machinery available for a grammar developer is the
Lexical Redistribution Rule (LRR). An LRR is a pair 
($r_{l}$, $r_{r}$) of subcategorization frames, 
which produces a new frame when applied to a subcategorization frame s,
by first {\it matching}\footnote{Matching occurs successfully when frame s
is compatible with $r_{l}$ in the type of anchors, the number of arguments,
their positions, categories and features. In other words, incompatible
features etc. will block certain LRRs from being applied.}
 the
left frame $r_{l}$ of r to s, then 
combining information in $r_{r}$ and s.
LRRs are introduced to incorporate
the connection between subcategorization frames. For example,
most transitive verbs have a frame for active(a subject and an object)
and another frame for passive, where the object in the former frame becomes
the subject in the latter. An LRR, denoted as  passive LRR,
is built to produce the passive subcategorization frame from
the active one.
Similarly, applying dative-shift LRR to the frame with
one NP subject and two NP objects will produce 
a frame with an NP subject and an PP object.


Besides the distinct content, LRRs and blocks also differ in several 
aspects:
\begin{itemize}
  \item They have different functionalities: Blocks represent
    the substructures that are reused in different trees. They
    are used to reduce the redundancy among trees; LRRs are introduced
    to incorporate the connections between the closely
     related subcategorization
    frames. 
  \item Blocks are strictly additive and can be added in any order.
       LRRs, on the other hand,
    produce different results depending on the order they are applied in,
    and
    are allowed to be non-additive, i.e., to remove information from 
    the subcategorization frame they are being applied to, as in
    the procedure of passive from active.
\end{itemize}

\caption{Elementary trees generated from combining blocks}
\label{elem}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Tree generation}
To generate elementary trees,
 we begin with a canonical subcategorization frame. 
The system will first generate 
related subcategorization frames 
by applying LRRs, then select
subcategorization blocks corresponding to the information in
the subcategorization frames, next 
the combinations of these blocks
are further combined with the blocks corresponding to
 various transformations, finally,  a set of trees are generated
from those combined blocks, and they are 
the tree family for this subcategorization frame. 
Figure \ref{elem} shows some
of the trees produced in this way.  For instance, the last tree is obtained by
incorporating information from the ditransitive verb subcategorization frame,
applying the dative-shift and passive LRRs, and then combining them with the
wh-non-subject extraction block. 
Besides, in our system the hierarchy for subcategorization frames is implicit
as shown in Figure \ref{lattice}.

\section{Implementation}

The input of our system is the description of the language, which includes 
the subcategorization frame list, LRR list, subcategorization block
list and transformation lists. The output  is a list of
trees generated automatically by the system, as shown in Figure
\ref{impl}. The tree generation module is written in Prolog, and 
the rest part is in C. We also have a graphic interface to input 
the language description. Figure \ref{interface-firstlevel} and
\ref{interface-block} are two snapshots of the interface.

\section{Generating grammars}

We have used our tool to specify a grammar for English in order to produce
the trees used in the current English XTAG grammar.
We have also used our tool
to generate a large grammar for Chinese.
In designing these
grammars, we have tried to specify the grammars to reflect the similarities and
the differences between the languages. The major features of our specification
of these two grammars\footnote{Both grammars are still under development,
so the contents of these two tables might change a lot in the future
according to
the analyses we choose for certain phenomenon. For example,
the majority of work on Chinese grammar treat ba-construction as some kind
of object-fronting where the character 
{\it ba} is either an object marker or a preposition. According to this
analysis, an LRR rule for ba-construction is used in our grammar to generate
the preverbal-object frame from the postverbal frame. However, there has
been some argument for treating {\it ba} as a verb. If we later choose
that analysis, the main verbs in the patterns ``NP0 VP'' and ``NP0 ba NP1 VP''
will be different, therefore no LRR will be needed for it. As a result, the
numbers of LRRs, subcat frames and tree generated will change accordingly.}
 are summarized in Table \ref{table} and \ref{table2}.

\end{tabular}  \\

\end{table}



By focusing on the specification of individual grammatical information, we
have been able to generate nearly all of the trees from the tree families 
used in the current English grammar developed at Penn\footnote{We have not yet
attempted to extend our coverage to include punctuation, it-clefts, and a few
idiosyncratic analyses.}. 
 Our approach, has also exposed certain gaps in the Penn grammar.
%in \ref{envgram97}.  
We are encouraged with the utility of our tool and the ease with which this
large-scale grammar was developed.


We are currently working on expanding the contents of
subcategorization frame to include 
trees for other categories of words. For example, 
a frame which has no specifier and one NP complement
and whose predicate is a preposition will correspond to
PP $\rightarrow$ P NP tree. We'll also introduce a modifier field
and semantic features, so that the head features will propagate
from modifiee to modified node, while non-head features from
the predicate as the head of the modifier will be passed to
the modified node.

\section{Summary}

We have described a tool for grammar development in which tree descriptions are
used to provide an abstract specification of the linguistic phenomena relevant
to a particular language.  In grammar development and maintenance, only the
abstract specifications need to be edited, and any changes or corrections will
automatically be proliferated throughout the grammar.  In addition to
lightening the more tedious aspects of grammar maintenance, this approach also
allows a unique perspective on the general characteristics of a language.
Defining hierarchical blocks for the grammar both necessitates and facilitates
an examination of the linguistic assumptions that have been made with regard to
feature specification and tree-family definition. This can be very useful for
gaining an overview of the theory that is being implemented and exposing gaps
that remain unmotivated and need to be investigated.  The type of gaps that can
be exposed could include a missing subcategorization frame that might arise
from the automatic combination of blocks and which would correspond to an
entire tree family, a missing tree which would represent a particular type of
transformation for a subcategorization frame, or inconsistent feature
equations.  By focusing on syntactic properties at a higher level, our
approach allows new opportunities for the investigation of how languages relate
to themselves and to each other.
