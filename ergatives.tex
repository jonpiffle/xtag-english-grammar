\chapter{Ergatives}
\label{ergatives}

Verbs in English that are termed ergative display the kind of
alternation shown in the sentences in (\ex{1}) and (\ex{2}) below.

\enumsentence{The sun melted the ice .}
\enumsentence{The ice melted .}

The pattern of ergative pairs as seen in (\ex{-1}) and (\ex{0}) is 
for the object of the transitive sentence to be the subject of the 
intransitive sentence.  The literature discussing such pairs is based 
largely on syntactic models that involve movement, particularly GB.  
Within that framework two basic approaches are discussed:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Derived Intransitive}\\ The intransitive member of the
ergative pair is derived through processes of movement and deletion from:
\begin{itemize}
\item a transitive D-structure \cite{Burzio86}; or	
\item transitive lexical structure \cite{HaleKeyser86,HaleKeyser87}
\end{itemize}

\item {\bf Pure Intransitive}\\ The intransitive member is intransitive at all levels of the
syntax and the lexicon and is not related to the transitive member
syntactically or lexically \cite{Napoli88}.
\end{itemize}


The Derived Intransitive approach's notions of movement in the lexicon
or in the grammar are not represented as such in the XTAG grammar.
However, distinctions drawn in these arguments can be translated to
the FB-LTAG framework.  In the XTAG grammar the difference between
these two approaches is not a matter of movement but rather a question
of tree family selection.  The relation between sentences represented
in terms of movement in other frameworks is represented in XTAG by
membership in the same tree family or selection of multiple families
which preserve the argument relations across families. Wh-questions
and their indicative counterparts are one example of the former,
whereas ergatives and ditransitives with PP shift exemplify the
latter.  Adopting the Pure Intransitive approach suggested by
\cite{Napoli88} would mean placing the intransitive ergatives in a
tree family with other intransitive verbs and separate from the
transitive variants of the same verbs.  This would result in a grammar
that represented intransitive ergatives as more closely related to
other intransitives than to their transitive counterparts.  The only
hint of the relation between the intransitive ergatives and the
transitive ergatives would be that ergative verbs would select both
tree families. While this is a workable solution, it is an
unattractive one for the English XTAG grammar because semantic
coherence is lost.  In particular, constancy in thematic role is
represented by constancy in node names across sentence types within a
tree family. For example, if the object of a declarative tree is
NP$_{1}$ the subject of the passive tree(s) in that family will also
be NP$_{1}$.  

The analysis that has been implemented in the English XTAG grammar is
an adaptation of the Derived Intransitive approach.  The ergatives
select the two families Tnx0Vnx1 and TEnx1V.  TEnx1V is quite similar
to the regular intransitive family Tnx0V, except that it encodes a
different type of semantic function---the syntactic subject of TEnx1V
is given the index of `1' to represent that it is the logical object
of the verb.  The two families Tnx0Vnx1 and TEnx1V create the two
possibilities needed to account for the data.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf intransitive ergative/transitive alternation.}  These verbs
have transitive and intransitive variants as shown in sentences~(\ex{1}) and
(\ex{2}).

\enumsentence{The sun melted the ice .}
\enumsentence{The ice melted .}

In the English XTAG grammar, verbs with this behavior select family
\{Tnx0Vnx1 $\cup$ TEnx1V\}.  The first family in the union handles
sentences such as (\ex{-1}) and the second covers (\ex{0}).

\item {\bf transitive only.}  Verbs of this type do not allow the
intransitive ergative variants, as can be seen in the pattern shown in
sentences~(\ex{1}) and (\ex{2}).

\enumsentence{Elmo borrowed a book .}
\enumsentence{$\ast$A book borrowed .}

Such verbs select only the family Tnx0Vnx1, and thus do not have the
ergative trees in TEnx1V available to them.

\end{itemize}

The declarative ergative tree is shown in Figure~\ref{decl-erg-tree}.
Note that the index of the subject NP indicates that it originated as
the object of the verb.
