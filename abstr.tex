\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a sizable grammar of English written in the TAG
formalism and implemented for use with the XTAG system. The version of
TAG used in this  grammar is lexicalized (Schabes, Abeille, Joshi
1988) and feature-based (Vijay-Shankar, Joshi 1988).  The grammar
discussed in this report extends the grammar presented in Abeille,
Bishop, Cote and Schabes (1990) in at least two ways. First, this
grammar has more detailed linguistic analysis, and second the grammar presented in this paper is fully implemented.
