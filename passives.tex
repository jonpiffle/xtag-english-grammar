\section{Passives}

In passive constructions such as (\ex{1} ) the subject NP is
interpreted as having the same role as the direct object NP in the
corresponding declarative  (\ex{2}).

(WSJ)}
\enumsentence{The House approved {\bf an airline buy-out bill}.}

 In a movement analysis, the direct object is said to have moved to
the subject position.  The original declarative subject is either
absent in the passive or is in a {\it by}-headed PP (by-phrase). In
the English LTAG grammar passive is having separate trees within the
appropriate tree families.  Passive trees are found in all tree
families that have a direct object in the declarative tree. Each of
these tree families has at least one passive tree with and one without
the by-phrase. Variations in the location of the by-phrase is possible
if a subcategorization includes other arguements such as a PP or
an indirect object. Additional trees are required for these variations
in {\bf by}-phrase location.  For example the tree family Tnx0Vnx1s2 will have
the passive trees shown in figures (\ref{passive1})-
(\ref{passive3}). Figure (\ref{passive1}) shows typical features for
the passive. The V node is required to have {\bf $<$passive$>=+$}
which has the effect of forcing adjunction of the passive {\it be}.
The other feature requirement on the V is that {\bf $,$mode$>=$ppart}
which has the effect of requiring it to have passive morphology.  Figures
(\ref{passive2}) and (\ref{passive3}) show variants in the location of
the by-phrase.
