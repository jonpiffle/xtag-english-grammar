\section{Imperative}
Imperatives in English do not have overt subjects, and the subject
role is always interpreted as being second person, i.e. {\it you}.
The imperative trees in English LTAG grammar are identical to the
declarative tree except that the NP$_{0}$ subject position is filled by an
$\epsilon$ and the NP$_{0}$ agr-pers feature is set in the tree to the
value 2. Figure \ref{Inx0Vnx1} is the imperative tree for the transitive tree
family.
