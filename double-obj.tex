\chapter{Ditransitive constructions and dative shift}
\label{double-objs}

Verbs such as {\it give\/} and {\it put\/} that require two objects, as
shown in examples (\ex{1})-(\ex{4}), are termed ditransitive.

\enumsentence{Christy gave a cannoli to Beth Ann .}
\enumsentence{$\ast$Christy gave Beth Ann .}
\enumsentence{Christy put a cannoli in the refrigerator .} 
\enumsentence{$\ast$Christy put a cannoli .}


The indirect objects {\it Beth Ann\/} and {\it refrigerator\/} appear in
these examples in the form of PP's.  Within the set of ditransitive
verbs there is a subset that also allow two NP's as in (\ex{1}). As can
be seen from (\ex{1}) and (\ex{2}) this two NP, or double-object,
construction is grammatical for {\it give\/} but not for {\it put}.  

\enumsentence{Christy gave Beth Ann a cannoli .}
\enumsentence{$\ast$Christy put the refrigerator the cannoli .}

The alternation between (\ex{-5}) and (\ex{-1}) is known as dative
shift.\footnote{In languages similar to English that have overt case
marking indirect objects would be marked with dative case. It has also
been suggested that for English the preposition {\it to} serves as a
dative case marker.} In order to account for verbs with dative shift
the English XTAG grammar includes structures for both variants in the
two tree families Tnx0Vnx1Pnx2 and Tnx0Vnx2nx1.  For an alternating
verb such as {\it give}, there are two anchoring instances: {\it give
to} selects Tnx0Vnx1Pnx2 and {\it give} selects Tnx0Vnx2nx1.  The
declarative trees for the shifted and non-shifted alternations are
shown in Figure~\ref{dative-alt}.

The indexing of nodes in these two trees represents the fact that the semantic
role of the indirect object (NP$_2$) in Figure~\ref{dative-alt}(a) is the same
as that of the direct object (NP$_2$) in Figure~\ref{dative-alt}(b) (and vice
versa).  This use of indexing is consistent with our treatment of other
constructions such as passive and ergative.

Verbs that do not show this alternation and have only the NP PP
structure (e.g. {\it put\/}) do not select the tree family
Tnx0Vnx2nx1.  Non-alternating verbs that select for particular prepositions 
take
Tnx0Vnx1Pnx2 and those which take a wider range of prepositions take
Tnx0Vnx1pnx2 (see Chapter~\ref{pp-complement-chapter} for more
exposition on the XTAG treatment of these constructions).  

Other verbs such as {\it ask} allow only the NP NP structure as shown
in (\ex{1}) and (\ex{2}).  These verbs select only the tree family
Tnx0Vnx2nx1.

\enumsentence{Beth Ann asked Srini a question .}
\enumsentence{$\ast$Beth Ann asked a question to Srini .}

There are other apparent cases of dative shift with {\it for}, such as 
the so called benefectives,
(\ex{1}) and (\ex{2}), that we have taken to be structurally distinct from the
cases with {\it to}.

\enumsentence{Beth Ann baked Dusty a biscuit .}
\enumsentence{Beth Ann baked a biscuit for Dusty .}

\cite{mccawley88} notes:

\begin{quote}
A ``{\it for-dative}'' expression in underlying structure is external
to the V with which it is combined, in view of the fact that the
latter behaves as a unit with regard to all relevant syntactic
phenomena.
\end{quote}


In other words, the {\it for} PP's that appear to undergo dative shift are
actually adjuncts, not complements. Examples (\ex{1}) and (\ex{2}) demonstrate
that PP's with {\it for} are optional while ditransitive {\it to} PP's are not.

\enumsentence{Beth Ann made dinner .}
\enumsentence{$\ast$Beth Ann gave dinner .}

Other evidence in support of the view that {\it for} PP's are adjuncts
comes from the {\it do so} test.  {\it Do so} substitutes for an entire VP. This
is illustrated in (\ex1), where {\it do so} substitutes for {\it ate a
banana}. The VP for which {\it do so} substitutes can exclude adjuncts (which
are adjoined to a VP) as in (\ex2), but not arguments, as shown in (\ex3). 

\enumsentence{John ate a banana and Mary did so too . (Mary ate a banana also)}
\enumsentence{John ate a banana in the morning and Mary did so in the evening.  (Mary ate a banana also and she ate it in the evening)}
\enumsentence{*John ate a banana and Mary did so an apple.}

\noindent The dative {\it to} phrase acts like an argument according to this
test (\ex1), but the {\it for} phrase does not (\ex2).

\enumsentence{John gave a book to Mary and Bill did so too .}
\enumsentence{*John gave a book to Mary and Bill did so to Janet .}

\enumsentence{John baked a cake for Mary and Bill did so too .}
\enumsentence{John baked a cake for Mary and Bill did so for Janet .}

Since {\it do so} substitutes for an entire VP, the fact that (\ex{0}) is
grammatical indicates that the {\it for} PP is an adjunct (i.e., there exists a
VP node lower than the {\it for} PP which {\it do so} can substitute for). 

Consequently, in the XTAG grammar the apparent dative shift with {\it
for} PP's is treated as Tnx0Vnx2nx1 for the NP NP structure, and as a
transitive plus an adjoined adjunct PP for the NP PP structure.  To
account for the ditransitive {\it to} PP's, the preposition {\it to}
co-anchors the tree family Tnx0Vnx1Pnx2 with the alternating
verb. 

\cite{mccawley88} also notes that the {\it to} and {\it for} cases
differ with respect to passivization; the indirect objects with {\it to} may be
the subjects of corresponding passives, as seen in ~(\ex{1})-(\ex{2}), while
the alleged indirect objects with {\it for} cannot, as in
sentences~(\ex{3})-(\ex{4}).  Note that the passivisation examples are for NP
NP structures of verbs that take {\it to} or {\it for} PP's.

\enumsentence{Beth Ann gave Clove dinner .}
\enumsentence{Clove was given dinner (by Beth Ann) .}
\enumsentence{Beth Ann made Clove dinner .}
\enumsentence{?Clove was made dinner (by Beth Ann) .} 

However, we believe that this picture is inaccurate, and that the indirect
objects in the {\it for} case are, in fact, allowed to be the subjects of
passives, as in sentences~(\ex{1})-(\ex{2}).  The apparent strangeness of
sentence~(\ex{0}) is caused by interference from other interpretations of {\it
Clove was made dinner .}

\enumsentence{Dania baked Doug a cake .}
\enumsentence{Doug was baked a cake by Dania .}
