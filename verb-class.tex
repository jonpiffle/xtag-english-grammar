\chapter{Verb Classes}
\label{verb-classes}

Each main\footnote{Auxiliary verbs are handled under a different
mechanism.  See Chapter~\ref{auxiliaries} for details.} verb in the
syntactic lexicon selects at least one tree family\footnote{See
section \ref{tree-db} for explanation of tree families.}
(subcategorization frame).  Since the tree database and syntactic
lexicon are already separated for space efficiency (see
Chapter~\ref{overview}), each verb can efficiently select a large
number of trees by specifying a tree family, as opposed to each of the
individual trees.  This approach allows for a considerable reduction
in the number of trees that must be specified for any given verb or
form of a verb.

There are currently 52 tree families in the system.\footnote{An
  explanation of the naming convention used in naming the trees and
  tree families is available in Appendix~\ref{tree-naming}.}  This
chapter gives a brief description of each tree family and shows the
corresponding declarative tree\footnote{Before lexicalization, the
  $\diamond$ indicates the anchor of the tree.}, along with any
peculiar characteristics or trees.  It also indicates which
transformations are in each tree family, and gives the number of verbs
that select that family.\footnote{Numbers given are as of August 1998
  and are subject to some change with further development of the
  grammar.} A few sample verbs are given, along with example
sentences.


\section{Intransitive: Tnx0V}\index{verbs, intransitive}
\label{nx0V-family}

\begin{description}
  
\item[Description:] This tree family is selected by verbs that do not
  require an object complement of any type.  Adverbs, prepositional
  phrases and other adjuncts may adjoin on, but are not required for
  the sentences to be grammatical.  1,878 verbs select this family.

\item[Examples:]  {\it eat}, {\it sleep}, {\it dance} \\
{\it Al ate .} \\ 
{\it Seth slept .} \\ 
{\it Hyun danced .}

\item[Declarative tree:]  See Figure~\ref{nx0V-tree}.

adjunct (gap-less) relative clause with comp,
adjunct (gap-less) relative clause with PP pied-piping,
imperative, determiner
gerund, NP gerund, pre-nominal participal.

\section{Transitive: Tnx0Vnx1}\index{verbs,transitive}
\label{nx0Vnx1-family}

\begin{description}
  
\item[Description:] This tree family is selected by verbs that require
  only an NP object complement.  The NP's may be complex structures,
  including gerund NP's and NP's that take sentential complements.
  This does not include light verb constructions (see
  sections~\ref{nx0lVN1-family} and \ref{nx0lVN1Pnx2-family}).  4,343
  verbs select the transitive tree family.

\item[Examples:] {\it eat}, {\it dance}, {\it take}, {\it like}\\
{\it Al ate an apple .} \\ 
{\it Seth danced the tango .} \\ 
{\it Hyun is taking an algorithms course .} \\
{\it Anoop likes the fact that the semester is finished .}

and no {\it by} phrase with and without comp, passive with relative clause on object on the
{\it by} phrase with and without comp/with PP pied-piping, 
gerund passive with {\it by} phrase, gerund passive
without {\it by} phrase, ergative, ergative with wh-moved subject,
ergative with subject relative clause with and without comp,
ergative with adjunct (gap-less) relative clause 
with comp/with PP pied-piping.  In addition, two other trees
that allow transitive verbs to function as adjectives (e.g. {\it the
stopped truck}) are also in the family.

\end{description}





\section{Ditransitive: Tnx0Vnx1nx2}\index{verbs,ditransitive}
\label{nx0Vnx1nx2-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:]  This tree family is selected by verbs that take exactly 
two NP complements.  It does {\bf not} include verbs that undergo the
ditransitive verb shift (see section~\ref{nx0Vnx1Pnx2-family}).  The apparent
ditransitive alternates involving verbs in this class and benefactive PP's
(e.g. {\it John baked a cake for Mary}) are analyzed as transitives (see
section~\ref{nx0Vnx1-family}) with a PP adjunct. Benefactives are
taken to be adjunct PP's because they are optional (e.g. {\it John baked a
cake} vs. {\it John baked a cake for Mary}).  122 verbs select the ditransitive
tree family.

\item[Examples:] {\it ask}, {\it cook}, {\it win} \\
{\it Christy asked Mike a question .} \\ 
{\it Doug cooked his father dinner .} \\
{\it Dania won her sister a stuffed animal .}

\section{Ditransitive with PP: Tnx0Vnx1pnx2}\index{verbs, NP with VP verbs}
\label{nx0Vnx1pnx2-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:]  This tree family is selected by ditransitive verbs that
take a noun phrase followed by a prepositional phrase.  The
preposition is not constrained in the syntactic lexicon.  The
preposition must be required and not optional - that is, the sentence
must be ungrammatical with just the noun phrase (e.g. {\it $\ast$John
put the table}).  No verbs, therefore, should select both this tree
family and the transitive tree family (see
section~\ref{nx0Vnx1-family}).  This tree family is also distinguished
from the ditransitive verbs, such as {\it give}, that undergo verb
shifting (see section~\ref{nx0Vnx1Pnx2-family}).  There are 62 verbs
that select this tree family.

\item[Examples:] {\it associate}, {\it put}, {\it refer} \\
{\it Rostenkowski associated money with power .}   \\
{\it He put his reputation on the line .}  \\
{\it He referred all questions to his attorney .}

\section{Ditransitive with PP shift: Tnx0Vnx1tonx2}\index{verbs,ditransitive
with PP shift}
\label{nx0Vnx1Pnx2-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:]  This tree family is selected by ditransitive verbs that
undergo a shift to a {\it to} prepositional phrase.  These ditransitive verbs
are clearly constrained so that when they shift, the prepositional phrase must
start with {\it to}.  This is in contrast to the Ditransitives with PP in
section~\ref{nx0Vnx1pnx2-family}, in which verbs may appear in [NP V NP PP]
constructions with a variety of prepositions.  Both the dative shifted and
non-shifted PP complement trees are included.  56 verbs select this family.

\item[Examples:] {\it give}, {\it promise}, {\it tell} \\
{\it Bill gave Hillary flowers .} \\ 
{\it Bill gave flowers to Hillary .} \\
{\it Whitman promised the voters a tax cut .} \\
{\it Whitman promised a tax cut to the voters .} \\
{\it Pinnochino told Gepetto a lie .} \\

\section{Sentential Complement with NP: Tnx0Vnx1s2}\index{verbs,Sentential
Complement with NP} 
\label{nx0Vnx1s2-family}

\begin{description}
  
\item[Description:] This tree family is selected by verbs that take
  both an NP and a sentential complement.  The sentential complement
  may be infinitive or indicative.  The type of clause is specified by
  each individual verb in its syntactic lexicon entry.  A given verb
  may select more than one type of sentential complement.  The
  declarative tree, and many other trees in this family, are auxiliary
  trees, as opposed to the more common initial trees.  These auxiliary
  trees adjoin onto an S node in an existing tree of the type
  specified by the sentential complement.  This is the mechanism by
  which TAGs are able to maintain long-distance dependencies (see
  Chapter~\ref{extraction}), even over multiple embeddings (e.g. {\it
    What did Bill tell Mary that John said?}).  79 verbs select this
  tree family.

\item[Examples:] {\it beg}, {\it expect}, {\it tell} \\
{\it Srini begged Mark to increase his disk quota .} \\
{\it Beth told Jim that it was his turn .}

\section{Intransitive Verb Particle: Tnx0Vpl}\index{verbs,verb-particle,intransitive}
\label{nx0Vpl}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:]  The trees in this tree family are anchored by both the
verb and the verb particle.  Both appear in the syntactic lexicon and together
select this tree family.  Intransitive verb particles can be difficult to
distinguish from intransitive verbs with adverbs adjoined on. The main
diagnostics for including verbs in this class are whether the meaning is
compositional or not, and whether there is a transitive version of the
verb/verb particle combination with the same or similar meaning.  The existence
of an alternate compositional meaning is a strong indication for a separate
verb particle construction.  There are 159 verb/verb particle combinations.

\item[Examples:] {\it add up}, {\it come out}, {\it sign off} \\
{\it The numbers never quite added up .} \\
{\it John finally came out (of the closet) .} \\
{\it I think that I will sign off now .}

\section{Transitive Verb Particle: Tnx0Vplnx1}\index{verbs,particle,transitive}
\label{nx0Vplnx1-family}

\begin{description}
  
\item[Description:] Verb/verb particle combinations that take an NP
  complement select this tree family.  Both the verb and the verb
  particle are anchors of the trees. Particle movement has been taken
  as the diagnostic to distinguish verb particle constructions from
  intransitives with adjoined PP's.  If the alleged particle is able
  to undergo particle movement, in other words appear both before and
  after the direct object, then it is judged to be a particle.  Items
  that do not undergo particle movement are taken to be prepositions.
  In many, but not all, of the verb particle cases, there is also an
  alternate prepositional meaning in which the lexical item did not
  move.  (e.g. {\it He looked up the number (in the phonebook).  He
    looked the number up. Srini looked up the road (for Purnima's
    car).  $\ast$He looked the road up.})  There are 489 verb/verb
  particle combinations.

\item[Examples:] {\it blow off}, {\it make up}, {\it pick out} \\
{\it He blew off his linguistics class for the third time .} \\
{\it He blew his linguistics class off for the third time .} \\
{\it The dyslexic leprechaun made up the syntactic lexicon .} \\
{\it The dyslexic leprechaun made the syntactic lexicon up .} \\

\begin{description}

\item[Description:]  Verb/verb particle combinations that select this tree
family take 2 NP complements.  Both the verb and the verb particle anchor the
trees, and the verb particle can occur before, between, or after the noun

seem to have passive alternations ({\it $\ast$A new bank account was opened up
Michelle by me}).  There are 4 verb/verb particle combinations that select
this tree family.  The exhaustive list is given in the examples.

\section{Intransitive with PP: Tnx0Vpnx1}\index{verbs,intransitive with PP}
\label{nx0Vpnx1-family}
\begin{description}

\item[Description:]  The verbs that select this tree family are not strictly 
intransitive, in that they {\bf must} be followed by a prepositional phrase.
Verbs that are intransitive and simply {\bf can} be followed by a prepositional
phrase do not select this family, but instead have the PP adjoin onto the
intransitive sentence.  Accordingly, there should be no verbs in both this
class and the intransitive tree family (see section~\ref{nx0V-family}).  The
prepositional phrase is not restricted to being headed by any particular
lexical item.  Note that these are not transitive verb particles (see
section~\ref{nx0Vplnx1-family}), since the head of the PP does not move.  169
verbs select this tree family.

\item[Examples:] {\it grab}, {\it impinge}, {\it provide} \\
{\it Seth grabbed for the brass ring .} \\
{\it The noise gradually impinged on Dania's thoughts .} \\
{\it A good host provides for everyone's needs .}

\section{Predicative Multi-word with Verb, Prep anchors: Tnx0VPnx1}\label{verbs,prepositional complement} 
\label{nx0VPnx1-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:] This tree family is selected by multiple anchor
verb/preposition pairs which together have a non-compositional
interpretation.  For example, {\it think of} has the non-compositional
interpretion involving the inception of a notion or mental entity in
addition to the interpretion in which the agent is thinking about
someone or something.  Anchors for this tree must be able to take both
gerunds and regular NP's in the second noun position.  To allow
adverbs to appear between the verb and the preposition, the trees
contain an extra VP level.  Several of the verbs which select the
Tnx0Vpnx1 family, but which should not have quite the freedom it
allows, will be moving to this family for the next release.  28
verb/preposition pairs select this tree family.

\item[Examples:] {\it think of}, {\it believe in}, {\it depend on} \\
{\it Calvin thought of a new idea .}\\
{\it Hobbes believes in sleeping all day .}\\
{\it Bill depends on drinking coffee for stimulation .}\\

\item[Declarative tree:] See Figure~\ref{nx0VPnx1-tree}.

\section{Sentential Complement: Tnx0Vs1}\label{verbs,sentential complement}
\label{nx0Vs1-family}

\begin{description}
  
\item[Description:] This tree family is selected by verbs that take
  just a sentential complement.  The sentential complement may be of
  type infinitive, indicative, or small clause (see
  Chapter~\ref{small-clauses}).  The type of clause is specified by
  each individual verb in its syntactic lexicon entry, and a given
  verb may select more than one type of sentential complement.  The
  declarative tree, and many other trees in this family, are auxiliary
  trees, as opposed to the more common initial trees.  These auxiliary
  trees adjoin onto an S node in an existing tree of the type
  specified by the sentential complement.  This is the mechanism by
  which TAGs are able to maintain long-distance dependencies (see
  Chapter~\ref{extraction}), even over multiple embeddings (e.g. {\it
    What did Bill think that John said?}). 338 verbs select this tree
  family.

\item[Examples:]  {\it consider}, {\it think} \\
{\it Dania considered the algorithm unworkable .}\\
{\it Srini thought that the program was working .} \\


\item[Declarative tree:]  See Figure~\ref{nx0Vs1-tree}.

\section{Intransitive with Adjective: Tnx0Vax1}\index{verbs,intransitive with adjective}
\label{nx0Vax1-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:]  The verbs that select this tree family take an adjective
as a complement.  The adjective may be regular, comparative, or superlative.
It may also be formed from the special class of adjectives derived from the
transitive verbs (e.g. {\it agitated, broken}).  See
section~\ref{nx0Vnx1-family}).  Unlike the Intransitive with PP verbs (see
section~\ref{nx0Vpnx1-family}), some of these verbs may also occur as bare
intransitives as well.  This distinction is drawn because adjectives do not
normally adjoin onto sentences, as prepositional phrases do.  Other
intransitive verbs can only occur with the adjective, and these select only
this family.  The verb class is also distinguished from the adjective small
clauses (see section~\ref{nx0Ax1-family}) because these verbs are not raising
verbs.  34 verbs select this tree family.

\item[Examples:] {\it become}, {\it grow}, {\it smell} \\
{\it The greenhouse became hotter .} \\
{\it The plants grew tall and strong .} \\
{\it The flowers smelled wonderful .}

\item[Declarative tree:]  See Figure~\ref{nx0Vax1-tree}.

\section{Transitive Sentential Subject:  Ts0Vnx1}\index{verbs,sentential subject}
\label{s0Vnx1-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:] The verbs that select this tree family all take sentential
subjects, and are often referred to as `psych' verbs, since they all refer to
some psychological state of mind.  The sentential subject can be indicative
(complementizer required) or infinitive (complementizer optional).
 100 verbs that select this tree family.

\item[Examples:] {\it delight}, {\it impress}, {\it surprise} \\
{\it that the tea had rosehips in it delighted Christy .} \\
{\it to even attempt a marathon impressed Dania .} \\
{\it For Jim to have walked the dogs surprised Beth .}

\section{Light Verbs: Tnx0lVN1}\index{verbs, light}
\label{nx0lVN1-family}

\begin{description}
  
\item[Description:] The verb/noun pairs that select this tree families
  are pairs in which the interpretation is non-compositional and the
  noun contributes argument structure to the predicate (e.g. {\it The
    man took a walk.} vs. {\it The man took a radio}).  The verb and
  the noun occur together in the syntactic database, and both anchor
  the trees.  The verbs in the light verb constructions are {\it do},
  {\it give}, {\it have}, {\it make} and {\it take}.  The noun
  following the light verb is (usually) in a bare infinitive form
  ({\it have a good cry}) and usually occurs with {\it a(n)}.
  However, we include deverbal nominals ({\it take a bath}, {\it give
    a demonstration}) as well.  Constructions with nouns that do not
  contribute an argument structure ({\it have a cigarette}, {\it give}
  NP {\it a black eye}) are excluded.  In addition to semantic
  considerations of light verbs, they differ syntactically from
  Transitive verbs (section~\ref{nx0Vnx1-family}) as well in that the
  noun in the light verb construction does not extract.  Some of the
  verb-noun anchors for this family, like {\it take aim} and {\it take
    hold} disallow determiners, while others require particular
  determiners.  For example, {\it have think} must be indefinite and
  singular, as attested by the ungrammaticality of *{\it John had the
    think/some thinks}.  Another anchor, {\it take leave} can occur
  either bare or with a possesive pronoun (e.g., {\it John took his
    leave}, but not *{\it John took the leave}).  This is accomplished
  through feature specification on the lexical entries.  There are 259
  verb/noun pairs that select the light verb tree.

\item[Examples:] {\it give groan}, {\it have discussion}, {\it make comment} \\
{\it The audience gave a collective groan .} \\
{\it We had a big discussion about closing the libraries .} \\
{\it The professors made comments on the paper .}

\item[Declarative tree:]  See Figure~\ref{nx0lVN1-tree}.

\section{Ditransitive Light Verbs with PP Shift: Tnx0lVN1Pnx2}\index{verbs,ditransitive light verbs with PP shift}
\label{nx0lVN1Pnx2-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:]  The verb/noun pairs that select this tree family are 
pairs in which the interpretation is non-compositional and the noun
contributes argument structure to the predicate (e.g. {\it Dania made
Srini a cake.} vs.  {\it Dania made Srini a loan}).  The verb and the
noun occur together in the syntactic database, and both anchor the
trees.  The verbs in these light verb constructions are {\it give} and
{\it make}.  The noun following the light verb is (usually) a bare
infinitive form (e.g. {\it make a promise to Anoop}).  However, we
include deverbal nominals (e.g. {\it make a payment to Anoop}) as
well.  Constructions with nouns that do not contribute an argument
structure are excluded.  In addition to semantic considerations of
light verbs, they differ syntactically from the Ditransitive with PP
Shift verbs (see section~\ref{nx0Vnx1Pnx2-family}) as well in that the
noun in the light verb construction does not extract.  Also,
passivization is severely restricted.  Special determiner requirments
and restrictions are handled in the same manner as for the Tnx0lVN1
family.  There are 18 verb/noun pairs that select this family.

\item[Examples:] {\it give look}, {\it give wave}, {\it make promise} \\
{\it Dania gave Carl a murderous look .} \\
{\it Amanda gave us a little wave as she left .} \\
{\it Dania made Doug a promise .}

\section{Locative Small Clause with Ad anchor: Tnx0nx1ARB}
\label{nx0nx1ARB-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:]  These trees are not anchored by verbs, but by adverbs 
that are part of locative adverbial phrases. Locatives are explained 
in much greater detail in the section on the locative modifier trees
(see section~\ref{locatives}). The only remarkable aspect of this tree 
family is the wh-moved locative tree, $\alpha$W1nx0nx1ARB, shown in 
Figure~\ref{W1nx0nx1ARB-tree}. This is the only tree family with this type of 
transformation, in which the entire adverbial phrase is wh-moved but not all 
elements are replaced by wh items (as in {\it how many city blocks away 
is the record store?}). Locatives that consist of just the locative adverb 
or the locative adverb and a degree adverb (see Section \ref{locatives} for 
details) are treated as exhaustive PPs and therefore select that tree 
family (Section~\ref{nx0Px1-family}) when used predicatively. For an 
extensive description of small clauses, see 
Section~\ref{sm-clause-xtag-analysis}. 26 adverbs select this tree family.

\item[Examples:] {\it ahead}, {\it offshore}, {\it behind} \\
{\it the crash is three blocks ahead} \\
{\it the naval battle was many kilometers offshore} \\
{\it how many blocks behind was Max?} \\

\section{Exceptional Case Marking: TXnx0Vs1}\index{verbs,ecm}
\label{Xnx0Vs1-family}

\begin{description}

\item[Description:]  This tree family is selected by verbs that are classified
as exceptional case marking, meaning that the verb asssigns accusative case
to the subject of the sentential complement.  This is in contrast to verbs
in the Tnx0Vnx1s2 family (section~\ref{nx0Vnx1s2-family}), which assign 
accusative
case to a NP which is not part of the sentential complement.  ECM verbs
take sentential complements which are either an infinitive or a ``bare''
infinitive.  As with the Tnx0Vs1 family (section~\ref{nx0Vs1-family}), the
declarative and other trees in the Xnx0Vs1 family are auxiliary trees, as
opposed to the more common initial trees.  These auxiliary trees adjoin onto an
S node in an existing tree of the type specified by the sentential complement.
This is the mechanism by which TAGs are able to maintain long-distance
dependencies (see Chapter~\ref{extraction}), even over multiple embeddings
(e.g. {\it Who did Bill expect to eat beans?}) or 
{\it who did Bill expect Mary to like?}  See section~\ref{ecm-verbs} 
for details on this family.  20 verbs select this tree family.

\item[Examples:]  {\it expect}, {\it see} \\
{\it Van expects Bob to talk .}
{\it Bob sees the harmonica fall .}

\item[Declarative tree:]  See Figure~\ref{Xnx0Vs1-tree}.

kicked the bucket.}).  Only a limited number of transformations are
allowed, as compared to the normal transitive tree family (see
section~\ref{nx0Vnx1-family}).  Other idioms that have the same
structure as {\it kick the bucket}, and that are limited to the same
transformations would select this tree, while different tree families
are used to handle other idioms.  Note that {\it John kicked the
bucket} is actually ambiguous, and would result in two parses - an
idiomatic one (meaning that John died), and a compositional transitive
one (meaning that there is an physical bucket that John hit with
his foot). 1 idiom selects this family.

\item[Examples:] {\it kick the bucket} \\
{\it Nixon kicked the bucket .}

\item[Declarative tree:]  See Figure~\ref{nx0VDN1-tree}.
